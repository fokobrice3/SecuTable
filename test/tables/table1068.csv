CVE-2021-43784,Candidate,"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f   |   URL:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f   |   MISC:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241   |   URL:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241   |   MISC:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554   |   URL:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554   |   MISC:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae   |   URL:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae   |   MISC:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f50369af4b571e358f20b139eea52d612eb55eed   |   URL:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f50369af4b571e358f20b139eea52d612eb55eed   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20211206 [SECURITY] [DLA 2841-1] runc security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00005.html",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up.

CVE-2021-43805,Candidate,"Solidus is a free, open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails. Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available. It is possible to edit the file `config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the maintainers in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9   |   URL:https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9   |   MISC:https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/9867153e01e3c3b898cdbcedd7b43375ea922401   |   URL:https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/9867153e01e3c3b898cdbcedd7b43375ea922401",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-43807,Candidate,"Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for Education. Opencast versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing, allowing to change the assumed HTTP method via URL parameter. This allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests into PUT requests or an HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft links or forms which may change the server state. This issue is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.0. You can mitigate the problem by setting the `SameSite=Strict` attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for you depends on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-j4mm-7pj3-jf7v   |   URL:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-j4mm-7pj3-jf7v   |   MISC:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/59cb6731067283e54f15462be38b6117d8b9ea8b#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8   |   URL:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/59cb6731067283e54f15462be38b6117d8b9ea8b#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8   |   MISC:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8f8271e1085f6f8e306c689d6a56b0bb8d076444   |   URL:https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8f8271e1085f6f8e306c689d6a56b0bb8d076444",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-43808,Candidate,"Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/laravel/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-66hf-2p6w-jqfw   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-66hf-2p6w-jqfw   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/b8174169b1807f36de1837751599e2828ceddb9b   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/b8174169b1807f36de1837751599e2828ceddb9b   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39906   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39906   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39908   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39908   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39909   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39909   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v6.20.42   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v6.20.42   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v7.30.6   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v7.30.6   |   MISC:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v8.75.0   |   URL:https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v8.75.0",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-43809,Candidate,"`Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/security/advisories/GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43   |   URL:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/security/advisories/GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43   |   MISC:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/0fad1ccfe9dd7a3c5b82c1496df3c2b4842870d3   |   URL:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/0fad1ccfe9dd7a3c5b82c1496df3c2b4842870d3   |   MISC:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/a4f2f8ac17e6ce81c689527a8b6f14381060d95f   |   URL:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/a4f2f8ac17e6ce81c689527a8b6f14381060d95f   |   MISC:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5142   |   URL:https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5142",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
