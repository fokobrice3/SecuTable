A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.","GENTOO:GLSA-201904-12   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12   |   MISC:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12181   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190422 [SECURITY] [DLA 1759-1] clamav security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/04/msg00019.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1208   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00064.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1210   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00062.html",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
