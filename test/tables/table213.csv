A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.","BID:105374   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105374   |   CISCO:20180919 Cisco Webex Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180919-webex   |   SECTRACK:1041689   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041689",Assigned (20180817),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2018-15423,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of a device via a clickjacking attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of iFrame data in HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets with malicious iFrame data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a clickjacking attack where the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link.","CISCO:20181003 Cisco HyperFlex UI Clickjacking Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-hyperflex-clickjacking",Assigned (20180817),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2018-15426,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.","CISCO:20181003 Cisco Unity Connection Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-uc-xss   |   SECTRACK:1041781   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041781",Assigned (20180817),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2018-15427,Candidate,"A vulnerability in Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) Software running on certain Cisco Connected Safety and Security Unified Computing System (UCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected system by using the root account, which has default, static user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, default, static user credentials for the root account of the affected software on certain systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system.

CVE-2018-15428,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.","CISCO:20181003 Cisco IOS XR Software Border Gateway Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-iosxr-dos   |   SECTRACK:1041790   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041790",Assigned (20180817),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
