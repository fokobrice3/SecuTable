CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2019-16767,HIGH,"The admin sys mode is now conditional and dedicated for the special case. By default, since ezmaster@5.2.11 no instance (container) is launched with advanced capabilities (not launched as root)"
CVE-2019-16768,MEDIUM,"In affected versions of Sylius, exception messages from internal exceptions (like database exception) are wrapped by \Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationServiceException and propagated through the system to UI. Therefore, some internal system information may leak and be visible to the customer. A validation message with the exception details will be presented to the user when one will try to log into the shop. This has been patched in versions 1.3.14, 1.4.10, 1.5.7, and 1.6.3."
CVE-2019-16769,LOW,"The serialize-javascript npm package before version 2.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions. If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability."
CVE-2019-1677,LOW,"A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings for Android could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack against the application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the application input parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the Webex Meetings application through an intent. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute script code in the context of the Webex Meetings application. Versions prior to 11.7.0.236 are affected."
CVE-2019-16770,MEDIUM,"In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2."
CVE-2019-16771,MEDIUM,"Versions of Armeria 0.85.0 through and including 0.96.0 are vulnerable to HTTP response splitting, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via CRLF sequences when unsanitized data is used to populate the headers of an HTTP response. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.97.0. Potential impacts of this vulnerability include cross-user defacement, cache poisoning, Cross-site scripting (XSS), and page hijacking."
CVE-2019-16772,MEDIUM,"The serialize-to-js NPM package before version 3.0.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions.

CVE-2019-16774,HIGH,"In phpfastcache before 5.1.3, there is a possible object injection vulnerability in cookie driver."
CVE-2019-16775,MEDIUM,Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of thenode_modules folder through the bin field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.
CVE-2019-16776,MEDIUM,Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.
CVE-2019-16777,MEDIUM,"Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option."
CVE-2019-16778,HIGH,"In TensorFlow before 1.15, a heap buffer overflow in UnsortedSegmentSum can be produced when the Index template argument is int32. In this case data_size and num_segments fields are truncated from int64 to int32 and can produce negative numbers, resulting in accessing out of bounds heap memory. This is unlikely to be exploitable and was detected and fixed internally in TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0."
CVE-2019-16779,MEDIUM,"In RubyGem excon before 0.71.0, there was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this."
CVE-2019-1678,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) to Cisco Meetings application users who are paired with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoint. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of coSpaces configuration parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting crafted strings in specific coSpace parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to prevent clients from joining a conference call in the affected coSpace. Versions prior to 2.4.3 are affected."
CVE-2019-16780,LOW,"WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject JavaScript code in the block editor using a specific payload, which is executed within the dashboard. This can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor. Execution of this attack does require an authenticated user. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are enabled by default for minor releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them enabled."
CVE-2019-16781,LOW,"In WordPress before 5.3.1, authenticated users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject JavaScript code in the block editor, which is executed within the dashboard. It can lead to an admin opening the affected post in the editor leading to XSS."
CVE-2019-16782,MEDIUM,"There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison."
CVE-2019-16784,MEDIUM,"In PyInstaller before version 3.6, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in this particular case: If a software using PyInstaller in ""onefile"" mode is launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current one) which have his ""TempPath"" resolving to a world writable directory. This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (TempPath will be C:\Windows\Temp). In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade)."
CVE-2019-16785,MEDIUM,"Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a ""MAY"" part of the RFC7230 which states: ""Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR."" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."
CVE-2019-16786,MEDIUM,"Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: ""Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked"" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."
CVE-2019-16787,Unknown,** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2019-19905. Reason: This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2019-19905.

Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2019-20043 instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage.
CVE-2019-16789,MEDIUM,"In Waitress through version 1.4.0, if a proxy server is used in front of waitress, an invalid request may be sent by an attacker that bypasses the front-end and is parsed differently by waitress leading to a potential for HTTP request smuggling. Specially crafted requests containing special whitespace characters in the Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed by Waitress as being a chunked request, but a front-end server would use the Content-Length instead as the Transfer-Encoding header is considered invalid due to containing invalid characters. If a front-end server does HTTP pipelining to a backend Waitress server this could lead to HTTP request splitting which may lead to potential cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.1 through more strict HTTP field validation."
CVE-2019-1679,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco TelePresence Conductor, Cisco Expressway Series, and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger an HTTP request from an affected server to an arbitrary host. This type of attack is commonly referred to as server-side request forgery (SSRF). The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for the REST API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected server. Versions prior to XC4.3.4 are affected."
CVE-2019-16790,MEDIUM,"In Tiny File Manager before 2.3.9, there is a remote code execution via Upload from URL and Edit/Rename files. Only authenticated users are impacted."
CVE-2019-16791,MEDIUM,"In postfix-mta-sts-resolver before 0.5.1, All users can receive incorrect response from daemon under rare conditions, rendering downgrade of effective STS policy."
CVE-2019-16792,MEDIUM,"Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0."
CVE-2019-1680,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Business Suite could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary text into a user's browser. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to view a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary text into the user's browser. The attacker could use the content injection to conduct spoofing attacks. Versions prior than 3.0.9 are affected."
CVE-2019-1681,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the TFTP service of Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the targeted device, possibly resulting in information disclosure. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input within TFTP requests processed by the affected software.

CVE-2019-1682,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the FUSE filesystem functionality for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device."
CVE-2019-1683,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the certificate handling component of the Cisco SPA112, SPA525, and SPA5X5 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to listen to or control some aspects of a Transport Level Security (TLS)-encrypted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) conversation. The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of server certificates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious server certificate to present to the client. An exploit could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on TLS-encrypted traffic and potentially route or redirect calls initiated by an affected device. Affected software include version 7.6.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA525 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA5X5 Series IP Phones and version 1.4.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA112 Series IP Phones."
