Versions prior to 2.4.3 are affected.","BID:106943   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106943   |   CISCO:20190206 Cisco Meeting Server Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-cms-dos",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-16782,Candidate,"There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/7fecaee81f59926b6e1913511c90650e76673b38   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-hrqr-hxpp-chr3   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-57fc0d0156   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HZXMWILCICQLA2BYSP6I2CRMUG53YBLX/   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20191218 Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/19/3   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20191218 [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/18/2   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20191219 Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/18/3   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200408 Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/09/2   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200409 Re: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/08/1   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0214   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-02/msg00016.html",Assigned (20190924),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Requests sent with: ""Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked"" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.
