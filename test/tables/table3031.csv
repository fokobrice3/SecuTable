CVE-2021-3450,MEDIUM,"The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a ""purpose"" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named ""purpose"" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

CVE-2021-34543,MEDIUM,"The web administration server in Solar-Log 500 before 2.8.2 Build 52 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to gain administrative privileges by connecting to the server. As a result, the attacker can modify configuration files and change the system status."
CVE-2021-34544,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Solar-Log 500 before 2.8.2 Build 52 23.04.2013. In /export.html, email.html, and sms.html, cleartext passwords are stored. This may allow sensitive information to be read by someone with access to the device."
CVE-2021-34546,HIGH,"An unauthenticated attacker with physical access to a computer with NetSetMan Pro before 5.0 installed, that has the pre-logon profile switch button within the Windows logon screen enabled, is able to drop to an administrative shell and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM via the ""save log to file"" feature. To accomplish this, the attacker can navigate to cmd.exe."
CVE-2021-34547,MEDIUM,PRTG Network Monitor 20.1.55.1775 allows /editsettings CSRF for user account creation.
CVE-2021-34548,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.4.6.5, aka TROVE-2021-003. An attacker can forge RELAY_END or RELAY_RESOLVED to bypass the intended access control for ending a stream."
CVE-2021-34549,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.4.6.5, aka TROVE-2021-005. Hashing is mishandled for certain retrieval of circuit data. Consequently. an attacker can trigger the use of an attacker-chosen circuit ID to cause algorithm inefficiency."
CVE-2021-3455,MEDIUM,"Disconnecting L2CAP channel right after invalid ATT request leads freeze. Zephyr versions >= 2.4.0, >= 2.5.0 contain Use After Free (CWE-416). For more information, see https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-7g38-3x9v-v7vp"
CVE-2021-34550,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.4.6.5, aka TROVE-2021-006. The v3 onion service descriptor parsing allows out-of-bounds memory access, and a client crash, via a crafted onion service descriptor"
CVE-2021-34551,MEDIUM,PHPMailer before 6.5.0 on Windows allows remote code execution if lang_path is untrusted data and has a UNC pathname.
CVE-2021-34552,HIGH,Pillow through 8.2.0 and PIL (aka Python Imaging Library) through 1.1.7 allow an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into a convert function to trigger a buffer overflow in Convert.c.
CVE-2021-34553,MEDIUM,Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.x before 3.31.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to get a list of blob files and read the content of a blob file (via a GET request) without having been granted access.

CVE-2021-34556,LOW,"In the Linux kernel through 5.13.7, an unprivileged BPF program can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a Speculative Store Bypass side-channel attack because the protection mechanism neglects the possibility of uninitialized memory locations on the BPF stack."
CVE-2021-34557,LOW,XScreenSaver 5.45 can be bypassed if the machine has more than ten disconnectable video outputs. A buffer overflow in update_screen_layout() allows an attacker to bypass the standard screen lock authentication mechanism by crashing XScreenSaver. The attacker must physically disconnect many video outputs.
CVE-2021-34558,LOW,"The crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic."
