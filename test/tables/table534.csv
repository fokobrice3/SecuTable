The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory.","BUGTRAQ:20190814 APPLE-SA-2019-08-13-5 SwiftNIO HTTP/2 1.5.0   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/24   |   BUGTRAQ:20190822 [SECURITY] [DSA 4505-1] nginx security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/40   |   CERT-VN:VU#605641   |   URL:https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/605641/   |   CONFIRM:https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10296   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190823-0002/   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190823-0005/   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K02591030   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K02591030?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS   |   CONFIRM:https://www.synology.com/security/advisory/Synology_SA_19_33   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4505   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4505   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-4427fd65be   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BP556LEG3WENHZI5TAQ6ZEBFTJB4E2IS/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-5a6a7bc12c   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CMNFX5MNYRWWIMO4BTKYQCGUDMHO3AXP/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-63ba15cc83   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XHTKU7YQ5EEP2XNSAV4M4VJ7QCBOJMOD/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-6a2980de56   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4ZQGHE3WTYLYAYJEIDJVF2FIGQTAYPMC/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-7a0b45fdc4   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/POPAEC4FWL4UU4LDEGPY5NPALU24FFQD/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-befd924cfe   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TAZZEVTCN2B4WT6AIBJ7XGYJMBTORJU5/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-d5b2c18fe6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H472D5HPXN6RRXCNFML3BK5OYC52CXF2/   |   FULLDISC:20190816 APPLE-SA-2019-08-13-5 SwiftNIO HTTP/2 1.5.0   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/16   |   MISC:https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2745   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2745   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2746   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2746   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2775   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2775   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2799   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2799   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2925   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2925   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2939   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2939   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2946   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2946   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2950   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2950   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2955   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2955   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2966   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2966   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:3932   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3932   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:3933   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3933   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2019:3935   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3935   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2114   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00032.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2115   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00031.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2120   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00035.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2264   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00014.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4099-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4099-1/",Assigned (20190301),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-9517,Candidate,"Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object.
