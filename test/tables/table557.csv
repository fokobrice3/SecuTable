CVE-2020-11008,Candidate,"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a ""blank"" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's ""store"" helper - Git's ""cache"" helper - the ""osxkeychain"" helper that ships in Git's ""contrib"" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-4e093619bb   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-b2a2c830cf   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-f6b3b6fb18   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/   |   FULLDISC:20200522 APPLE-SA-2020-05-20-1 Xcode 11.5   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202004-13   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13   |   MISC:https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282   |   MISC:https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20200424 [SECURITY] [DLA 2182-1] git security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0598   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4334-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/",Assigned (20200330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2020-11009,Candidate,"In Rundeck before version 3.2.6, authenticated users can craft a request that reveals Execution data and logs and Job details that they are not authorized to see. Depending on the configuration and the way that Rundeck is used, this could result in anything between a high severity risk, or a very low risk. If access is tightly restricted and all users on the system have access to all projects, this is not really much of an issue. If access is wider and allows login for users that do not have access to any projects, or project access is restricted, there is a larger issue.

CVE-2020-11013,Candidate,"Their is an information disclosure vulnerability in Helm from version 3.1.0 and before version 3.2.0. `lookup` is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. It is able to lookup resources in the cluster to check for the existence of specific resources and get details about them. This can be used as part of the process to render templates. The documented behavior of `helm template` states that it does not attach to a remote cluster. However, a the recently added `lookup` template function circumvents this restriction and connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run`. The user is not notified of this behavior. Running `helm template` should not make calls to a cluster. This is different from `install`, which is presumed to have access to a cluster in order to load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 is unaffected by this vulnerability. A malicious chart author could inject a `lookup` into a chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performs unannounced lookups against the cluster a user&#39;s `KUBECONFIG` file points to. This information can then be disclosed via the output of `helm template`.
