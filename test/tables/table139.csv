CWE-ID,Name,Weakness Abstraction,Status,Description
203,Observable Discrepancy,Base,Incomplete,The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.
226,Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse,Base,Draft,The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or zeroize the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.
276,Incorrect Default Permissions,Base,Draft,During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.
319,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
325,Missing Cryptographic Step,Base,Draft,The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.
440,Expected Behavior Violation,Base,Draft,A feature, API, or function does not perform according to its specification.
441,Unintended Proxy or Intermediary ('Confused Deputy'),Class,Draft,The product receives a request, message, or directive from an upstream component, but the product does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request to an external actor that is outside of the product's control sphere. This causes the product to appear to be the source of the request, leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor.
1053,Missing Documentation for Design,Base,Incomplete,The product does not have documentation that represents how it is designed.
1059,Insufficient Technical Documentation,Class,Incomplete,The product does not contain sufficient technical or engineering documentation (whether on paper or in electronic form) that contains descriptions of all the relevant software/hardware elements of the product, such as its usage, structure, architectural components, interfaces, design, implementation, configuration, operation, etc.
1189,Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC),Base,Stable,The System-On-a-Chip (SoC) does not properly isolate shared resources between trusted and untrusted agents.
1190,DMA Device Enabled Too Early in Boot Phase,Base,Draft,The product enables a Direct Memory Access (DMA) capable device before the security configuration settings are established, which allows an attacker to extract data from or gain privileges on the product.
1191,On-Chip Debug and Test Interface With Improper Access Control,Base,Stable,The chip does not implement or does not correctly perform access control to check whether users are authorized to access internal registers and test modes through the physical debug/test interface.
1192,System-on-Chip (SoC) Using Components without Unique, Immutable Identifiers,Base,Draft,The System-on-Chip (SoC) does not have unique, immutable identifiers for each of its components.

1209,Failure to Disable Reserved Bits,Base,Incomplete,The reserved bits in a hardware design are not disabled prior to production. Typically, reserved bits are used for future capabilities and should not support any functional logic in the design. However, designers might covertly use these bits to debug or further develop new capabilities in production hardware. Adversaries with access to these bits will write to them in hopes of compromising hardware state.
1220,Insufficient Granularity of Access Control,Base,Incomplete,The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.
1221,Incorrect Register Defaults or Module Parameters,Base,Incomplete,Hardware description language code incorrectly defines register defaults or hardware IP parameters to insecure values.
1222,Insufficient Granularity of Address Regions Protected by Register Locks,Variant,Incomplete,The product defines a large address region protected from modification by the same register lock control bit.

1231,Improper Prevention of Lock Bit Modification,Base,Stable,The product uses a trusted lock bit for restricting access to registers, address regions, or other resources, but the product does not prevent the value of the lock bit from being modified after it has been set.
1232,Improper Lock Behavior After Power State Transition,Base,Incomplete,Register lock bit protection disables changes to system configuration once the bit is set. Some of the protected registers or lock bits become programmable after power state transitions (e.g., Entry and wake from low power sleep modes) causing the system configuration to be changeable.
1233,Security-Sensitive Hardware Controls with Missing Lock Bit Protection,Base,Stable,The product uses a register lock bit protection mechanism, but it does not ensure that the lock bit prevents modification of system registers or controls that perform changes to important hardware system configuration.
1234,Hardware Internal or Debug Modes Allow Override of Locks,Base,Incomplete,System configuration protection may be bypassed during debug mode.
1239,Improper Zeroization of Hardware Register,Variant,Draft,The hardware product does not properly clear sensitive information from built-in registers when the user of the hardware block changes.

1244,Internal Asset Exposed to Unsafe Debug Access Level or State,Base,Stable,The product uses physical debug or test interfaces with support for multiple access levels, but it assigns the wrong debug access level to an internal asset, providing unintended access to the asset from untrusted debug agents.
1245,Improper Finite State Machines (FSMs) in Hardware Logic,Base,Incomplete,Faulty finite state machines (FSMs) in the hardware logic allow an attacker to put the system in an undefined state, to cause a denial of service (DoS) or gain privileges on the victim's system.
1246,Improper Write Handling in Limited-write Non-Volatile Memories,Base,Incomplete,The product does not implement or incorrectly implements wear leveling operations in limited-write non-volatile memories.
1247,Improper Protection Against Voltage and Clock Glitches,Base,Stable,The device does not contain or contains incorrectly implemented circuitry or sensors to detect and mitigate voltage and clock glitches and protect sensitive information or software contained on the device.
1248,Semiconductor Defects in Hardware Logic with Security-Sensitive Implications,Base,Incomplete,The security-sensitive hardware module contains semiconductor defects.
1250,Improper Preservation of Consistency Between Independent Representations of Shared State,Base,Incomplete,The product has or supports multiple distributed components or sub-systems that are each required to keep their own local copy of shared data - such as state or cache - but the product does not ensure that all local copies remain consistent with each other.
1251,Mirrored Regions with Different Values,Base,Incomplete,The product's architecture mirrors regions without ensuring that their contents always stay in sync.
1252,CPU Hardware Not Configured to Support Exclusivity of Write and Execute Operations,Base,Incomplete,The CPU is not configured to provide hardware support for exclusivity of write and execute operations on memory. This allows an attacker to execute data from all of memory.
1253,Incorrect Selection of Fuse Values,Base,Draft,The logic level used to set a system to a secure state relies on a fuse being unblown. An attacker can set the system to an insecure state merely by blowing the fuse.
1254,Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity,Base,Draft,The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.
1255,Comparison Logic is Vulnerable to Power Side-Channel Attacks,Variant,Draft,A device's real time power consumption may be monitored during security token evaluation and the information gleaned may be used to determine the value of the reference token.
1256,Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features,Base,Stable,The product provides software-controllable device functionality for capabilities such as power and clock management, but it does not properly limit functionality that can lead to modification of hardware memory or register bits, or the ability to observe physical side channels.
1257,Improper Access Control Applied to Mirrored or Aliased Memory Regions,Base,Incomplete,Aliased or mirrored memory regions in hardware designs may have inconsistent read/write permissions enforced by the hardware. A possible result is that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory region but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory region.
1258,Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information,Base,Draft,The hardware does not fully clear security-sensitive values, such as keys and intermediate values in cryptographic operations, when debug mode is entered.
1259,Improper Restriction of Security Token Assignment,Base,Incomplete,The System-On-A-Chip (SoC) implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens are improperly protected.

1264,Hardware Logic with Insecure De-Synchronization between Control and Data Channels,Base,Incomplete,The hardware logic for error handling and security checks can incorrectly forward data before the security check is complete.
1266,Improper Scrubbing of Sensitive Data from Decommissioned Device,Base,Incomplete,The product does not properly provide a capability for the product administrator to remove sensitive data at the time the product is decommissioned. A scrubbing capability could be missing, insufficient, or incorrect.
1267,Policy Uses Obsolete Encoding,Base,Draft,The product uses an obsolete encoding mechanism to implement access controls.
1268,Policy Privileges are not Assigned Consistently Between Control and Data Agents,Base,Draft,The product's hardware-enforced access control for a particular resource improperly accounts for privilege discrepancies between control and write policies.
1269,Product Released in Non-Release Configuration,Base,Incomplete,The product released to market is released in pre-production or manufacturing configuration.
1270,Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens,Base,Incomplete,The product implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens generated in the system are incorrect.
