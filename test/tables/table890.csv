CVE-2021-25216,Candidate,"In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.","CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210521-0006/   |   CONFIRM:https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2021-25215   |   URL:https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2021-25215   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4909   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4909   |   MISC:https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-657/   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210504 [SECURITY] [DLA 2647-1] bind9 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00001.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210428 ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/1   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/2   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/3   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210429 Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/29/4",Assigned (20210115),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.","CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-406691.pdf   |   CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-637483.pdf   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220325-0011/   |   CONFIRM:https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25217   |   URL:https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2021-25217   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-08cdb4dc34   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LB42JWIV4M4WDNXX5VGIP26FEYWKIF/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8ca8263bde   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5QI4DYC7J4BGHEW3NH4XHMWTHYC36UK4/   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210603 [SECURITY] [DLA 2674-1] isc-dhcp security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/06/msg00002.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210526 ISC has disclosed a vulnerability in ISC DHCP (CVE-2021-25217)   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/26/6",Assigned (20210115),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
