CVE-2019-1547,Candidate,"Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).","BUGTRAQ:20190912 [slackware-security] openssl (SSA:2019-254-03)   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/25   |   BUGTRAQ:20191001 [SECURITY] [DSA 4539-1] openssl security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/1   |   BUGTRAQ:20191001 [SECURITY] [DSA 4540-1] openssl1.0 security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/0   |   CONFIRM:https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10365   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=21c856b75d81eff61aa63b4f036bb64a85bf6d46   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=21c856b75d81eff61aa63b4f036bb64a85bf6d46   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=30c22fa8b1d840036b8e203585738df62a03cec8   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=30c22fa8b1d840036b8e203585738df62a03cec8   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7c1709c2da5414f5b6133d00a03fc8c5bf996c7a   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=7c1709c2da5414f5b6133d00a03fc8c5bf996c7a   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200122-0002/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200122-0002/   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200416-0003/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200416-0003/   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K73422160?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS   |   URL:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K73422160?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS   |   CONFIRM:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt   |   URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-08   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-08   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4539   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4539   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4540   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4540   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d15aac6c4e   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GY6SNRJP2S7Y42GIIDO3HXPNMDYN2U3A/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d51641f152   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZN4VVQJ3JDCHGIHV4Y2YTXBYQZ6PWQ7E/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-201911-04   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201911-04   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154467/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html   |   URL:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154467/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html   |   MISC:https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01785   |   URL:https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01785   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190925 [SECURITY] [DLA 1932-1] openssl security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00026.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2158   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00054.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2189   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00072.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2268   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00012.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2269   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00016.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4376-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4376-2   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-2/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4504-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4504-1/",Assigned (20181128),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-1549,Candidate,"OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.

CVE-2019-1551,Candidate,"There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).","BUGTRAQ:20191225 [slackware-security] openssl (SSA:2019-354-01)   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/39   |   BUGTRAQ:20191229 [SECURITY] [DSA 4594-1] openssl1.0 security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/46   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=419102400a2811582a7a3d4a4e317d72e5ce0a8f   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=419102400a2811582a7a3d4a4e317d72e5ce0a8f   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=f1c5eea8a817075d31e43f5876993c6710238c98   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=f1c5eea8a817075d31e43f5876993c6710238c98   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0001/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191210-0001/   |   CONFIRM:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt   |   URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20191206.txt   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-03   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-03   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10   |   URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4594   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4594   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4855   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4855   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-d7b29838f6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EXDDAOWSAIEFQNBHWYE6PPYFV4QXGMCD/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-da2d1ef2d7   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDHOAATPWJCXRNFMJ2SASDBBNU5RJONY/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-fcc91a28e8   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XVEP3LAK4JSPRXFO4QF4GG2IVXADV3SO/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202004-10   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-10   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155754/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html   |   URL:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155754/Slackware-Security-Advisory-openssl-Updates.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20220317 [SECURITY] [DLA 2952-1] openssl security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00023.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0062   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00030.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4376-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4504-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4504-1/",Assigned (20181128),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-1552,Candidate,"OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).
