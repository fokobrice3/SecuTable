CVE-2023-25557,Candidate,"DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The DataHub frontend acts as a proxy able to forward any REST or GraphQL requests to the backend. The goal of this proxy is to perform authentication if needed and forward HTTP requests to the DataHub Metadata Store (GMS). It has been discovered that the proxy does not adequately construct the URL when forwarding data to GMS, allowing external users to reroute requests from the DataHub Frontend to any arbitrary hosts. As a result attackers may be able to reroute a request from originating from the frontend proxy to any other server and return the result. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-076.","MISC:https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-5w2h-q83m-65xg   |   URL:https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-5w2h-q83m-65xg",Assigned (20230207),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2023-25558,Candidate,"DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When the DataHub frontend is configured to authenticate via SSO, it will leverage the pac4j library.

CVE-2023-25578,Candidate,"Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version 1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially unauthenticated attacker to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM. The multipart body parser processes an unlimited number of file parts and an unlimited number of field parts. This is a remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`. The large amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all available worker processes and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests. The large amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can lead to Out-Of-Memory kills. Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart requests in a loop. Version 1.51.2 contains a patch for this issue.","MISC:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/commit/9674fe803628f986c03fe60769048cbc55b5bf83   |   URL:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/commit/9674fe803628f986c03fe60769048cbc55b5bf83   |   MISC:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v1.51.2   |   URL:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/releases/tag/v1.51.2   |   MISC:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/security/advisories/GHSA-p24m-863f-fm6q   |   URL:https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite/security/advisories/GHSA-p24m-863f-fm6q",Assigned (20230207),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-25657,Candidate,"Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.5.7 are impacted by a remote code execution vulnerability. Nautobot did not properly sandbox Jinja2 template rendering. In Nautobot 1.5.7 has enabled sandboxed environments for the Jinja2 template engine used internally for template rendering for the following objects: `extras.ComputedField`, `extras.CustomLink`, `extras.ExportTemplate`, `extras.Secret`, `extras.Webhook`. While no active exploits of this vulnerability are known this change has been made as a preventative measure to protect against any potential remote code execution attacks utilizing maliciously crafted template code. This change forces the Jinja2 template engine to use a `SandboxedEnvironment` on all new installations of Nautobot. This addresses any potential unsafe code execution everywhere the helper function `nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2` is called. Additionally, the documentation that had previously suggesting the direct use of `jinja2.Template` has been revised to suggest `render_jinja2`. Users are advised to upgrade to Nautobot 1.5.7 or newer. For users that are unable to upgrade to the latest release of Nautobot, you may add the following setting to your `nautobot_config.py` to apply the sandbox environment enforcement: `TEMPLATES[1][""OPTIONS""][""environment""] = ""jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment""` After applying this change, you must restart all Nautobot services, including any Celery worker processes. **Note:** *Nautobot specifies two template engines by default, the first being &#8220;django&#8221; for the Django built-in template engine, and the second being &#8220;jinja&#8221; for the Jinja2 template engine. This recommended setting will update the second item in the list of template engines, which is the Jinja2 engine.* For users that are unable to immediately update their configuration such as if a Nautobot service restart is too disruptive to operations, access to provide custom Jinja2 template values may be mitigated using permissions to restrict &#8220;change&#8221; (write) actions to the affected object types listed in the first section. **Note:** *This solution is intended to be stopgap until you can successfully update your `nautobot_config.py` or upgrade your Nautobot instance to apply the sandboxed environment enforcement.*","MISC:https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/d47f157e83b0c353bb2b697f911882c71cf90ca0   |   URL:https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/d47f157e83b0c353bb2b697f911882c71cf90ca0   |   MISC:https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-8mfq-f5wj-vw5m   |   URL:https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-8mfq-f5wj-vw5m   |   MISC:https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/#sandbox   |   URL:https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/#sandbox",Assigned (20230209),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
