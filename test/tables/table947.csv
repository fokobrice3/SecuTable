The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210813-0001/   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4920   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4920   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-62bb9998b2   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEOT4RLB76RVPJQKGGTIKTBIOLHX2NR6/   |   FULLDISC:20210520 CVE-2021-31535 libX11 Insufficient Length Checks PoC and Archeology   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/May/52   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202105-16   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-16   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162737/libX11-Insufficient-Length-Check-Injection.html   |   MISC:https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605   |   MISC:https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/   |   MISC:https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2021-May/003088.html   |   MISC:https://unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210518-using-xterm-to-navigate-the-huge-color-space/   |   MISC:https://unparalleled.eu/publications/2021/advisory-unpar-2021-1.txt   |   MISC:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2   |   MISC:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/3   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210524 [SECURITY] [DLA 2666-1] libx11 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00021.html   |   MLIST:[kafka-dev] 20210831 Security vulnerabilities in kafka:2.13-2.6.0/2.7.0 docker image   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[kafka-dev] 20210901 Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: Security vulnerabilities in kafka:2.13-2.6.0/2.7.0 docker image   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[kafka-users] 20210831 Security vulnerabilities in kafka:2.13-2.6.0/2.7.0 docker image   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[kafka-users] 20210901 Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: Security vulnerabilities in kafka:2.13-2.6.0/2.7.0 docker image   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210518 libX11 security advisory: May 18, 2021   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2",Assigned (20210421),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
