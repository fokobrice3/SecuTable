Amcrest cloud services does not perform a thorough verification when allowing the user to add a new camera to the user's account to ensure that the user actually owns the camera other than knowing the serial number of the camera. This can allow an attacker who knows the serial number to easily add another user's camera to an attacker's cloud account and control it completely. This is possible in case of any camera that is currently not a part of an Amcrest cloud account or has been removed from the user's cloud account. Also, another requirement for a successful attack is that the user should have rebooted the camera in the last two hours. However, both of these conditions are very likely for new cameras that are sold over the Internet at many ecommerce websites or vendors that sell the Amcrest products. The successful attack results in an attacker being able to completely control the camera which includes being able to view and listen on what the camera can see, being able to change the motion detection settings and also be able to turn the camera off without the user being aware of it.

If one TELNETs into the device and navigates to /mnt/mtd/Config folder, one can observe that it contains various files such as Account1, Account2, SHAACcount1, etc. This means that if one navigates to http://[IPofcamera]/current_config/Sha1Account1 then one should be able to view the content of the files. The security researchers assumed that this was only possible only after authentication to the device. However, when unauthenticated access tests were performed for the same URL as provided above, it was observed that the device file could be downloaded without any authentication.","BUGTRAQ:20190609 Newly releases IoT security issues   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153224/Amcrest-IPM-721S-Credential-Disclosure-Privilege-Escalation.html   |   MISC:https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Amcrest_sec_issues.pdf",Assigned (20170425),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2017-8230,Candidate,"On Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices, the users on the device are divided into 2 groups ""admin"" and ""user"". However, as a part of security analysis it was identified that a low privileged user who belongs to the ""user"" group and who has access to login in to the web administrative interface of the device can add a new administrative user to the interface using HTTP APIs provided by the device and perform all the actions as an administrative user by using that account. If the firmware version V2.420.AC00.16.R 9/9/2016 is dissected using binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary ""sonia"" is the one that has the vulnerable functions that performs the various action described in HTTP APIs. If one opens this binary in IDA-pro one will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function at address 0x00429084 in IDA pro is the one that processes the HTTP API request for ""addUser"" action. If one traces the calls to this function, it can be clearly seen that the function sub_ 41F38C at address 0x0041F588 parses the call received from the browser and passes it to the ""addUser"" function without any authorization check.","MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153224/Amcrest-IPM-721S-Credential-Disclosure-Privilege-Escalation.html   |   MISC:https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Amcrest_sec_issues.pdf",Assigned (20170425),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
