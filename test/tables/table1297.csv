CVE-2022-38152,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session, the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the second session, which is created through TLS session resumption and reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL* ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers that use wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of wolfSSL's native API.","CONFIRM:https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/   |   FULLDISC:20230119 wolfSSL before 5.5.0: Denial-of-service with session resumption   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/7   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170604/wolfSSL-Session-Resumption-Denial-Of-Service.html   |   MISC:https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/   |   MISC:https://github.com/tlspuffin/tlspuffin   |   MISC:https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5468   |   MISC:https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases",Assigned (20220811),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2022-38153,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable. Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with a ""free(): invalid pointer"" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.","CONFIRM:https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/   |   FULLDISC:20230119 wolfSSL 5.3.0: Denial-of-service   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/8   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170605/wolfSSL-5.3.0-Denial-Of-Service.html   |   MISC:https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/   |   MISC:https://github.com/trailofbits/tlspuffin   |   MISC:https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5476   |   MISC:https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases",Assigned (20220811),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
