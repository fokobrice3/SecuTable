CVE-2018-10900,HIGH,"Network Manager VPNC plugin (aka networkmanager-vpnc) before version 1.2.6 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. A new line character can be used to inject a Password helper parameter into the configuration data passed to VPNC, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root."
CVE-2018-10901,HIGH,"A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges."
CVE-2018-10902,MEDIUM,It was found that the raw midi kernel driver does not protect against concurrent access which leads to a double realloc (double free) in snd_rawmidi_input_params() and snd_rawmidi_output_status() which are part of snd_rawmidi_ioctl() handler in rawmidi.c file. A malicious local attacker could possibly use this for privilege escalation.
CVE-2018-10903,MEDIUM,A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.
CVE-2018-10904,MEDIUM,"It was found that glusterfs server does not properly sanitize file paths in the ""trusted.io-stats-dump"" extended attribute which is used by the ""debug/io-stats"" translator. Attacker can use this flaw to create files and execute arbitrary code. To exploit this attacker would require sufficient access to modify the extended attributes of files on a gluster volume."
CVE-2018-10905,HIGH,CloudForms Management Engine (cfme) is vulnerable to an improper security setting in the dRuby component of CloudForms. An attacker with access to an unprivileged local shell could use this flaw to execute commands as a high privileged user.
CVE-2018-10906,MEDIUM,"In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system, accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects."
CVE-2018-10907,MEDIUM,It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause crash or potential code execution.
CVE-2018-10908,HIGH,"It was found that vdsm before version 4.20.37 invokes qemu-img on untrusted inputs without limiting resources. By uploading a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause the qemu-img process to consume unbounded amounts of memory of CPU time, causing a denial of service condition that could potentially impact other users of the host."
CVE-2018-10909,Unknown,** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.
CVE-2018-1091,MEDIUM,"In the flush_tmregs_to_thread function in arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5, a guest kernel crash can be triggered from unprivileged userspace during a core dump on a POWER host due to a missing processor feature check and an erroneous use of transactional memory (TM) instructions in the core dump path, leading to a denial of service."
CVE-2018-10910,LOW,A bug in Bluez may allow for the Bluetooth Discoverable state being set to on when no Bluetooth agent is registered with the system. This situation could lead to the unauthorized pairing of certain Bluetooth devices without any form of authentication. Versions before bluez 5.51 are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-10911,MEDIUM,A flaw was found in the way dic_unserialize function of glusterfs does not handle negative key length values. An attacker could use this flaw to read memory from other locations into the stored dict value.
CVE-2018-10912,MEDIUM,keycloak before version 4.0.0.final is vulnerable to a infinite loop in session replacement. A Keycloak cluster with multiple nodes could mishandle an expired session replacement and lead to an infinite loop. A malicious authenticated user could use this flaw to achieve Denial of Service on the server.
CVE-2018-10913,MEDIUM,An information disclosure vulnerability was discovered in glusterfs server. An attacker could issue a xattr request via glusterfs FUSE to determine the existence of any file.
CVE-2018-10914,MEDIUM,It was found that an attacker could issue a xattr request via glusterfs FUSE to cause gluster brick process to crash which will result in a remote denial of service. If gluster multiplexing is enabled this will result in a crash of multiple bricks and gluster volumes.
CVE-2018-10915,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability was found in libpq, the default PostgreSQL client library where libpq failed to properly reset its internal state between connections. If an affected version of libpq was used with ""host"" or ""hostaddr"" connection parameters from untrusted input, attackers could bypass client-side connection security features, obtain access to higher privileged connections or potentially cause other impact through SQL injection, by causing the PQescape() functions to malfunction. Postgresql versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24 are affected."
CVE-2018-10916,HIGH,"It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory of the victim's system."
CVE-2018-10917,MEDIUM,pulp 2.16.x and possibly older is vulnerable to an improper path parsing. A malicious user or a malicious iso feed repository can write to locations accessible to the 'apache' user. This may lead to overwrite of published content on other iso repositories.
CVE-2018-10918,MEDIUM,A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the way samba checked database outputs from the LDB database layer. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash a samba server in an Active Directory Domain Controller configuration. Samba versions before 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-10919,MEDIUM,"The Samba Active Directory LDAP server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw because of missing access control checks. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to extract confidential attribute values using LDAP search expressions. Samba versions before 4.6.16, 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable."
CVE-2018-1092,HIGH,"The ext4_iget function in fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 mishandles the case of a root directory with a zero i_links_count, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (ext4_process_freed_data NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted ext4 image."
CVE-2018-10920,MEDIUM,Improper input validation bug in DNS resolver component of Knot Resolver before 2.4.1 allows remote attacker to poison cache.
CVE-2018-10921,MEDIUM,Certain input files may trigger an integer overflow in ttembed input file processing. This overflow could potentially lead to corruption of the input file due to a lack of checking return codes of fgetc/fputc function calls.
CVE-2018-10922,MEDIUM,"An input validation flaw exists in ttembed. With a crafted input file, an attacker may be able to trigger a denial of service condition due to ttembed trusting attacker controlled values."
