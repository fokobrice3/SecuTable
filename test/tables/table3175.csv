There are an almost limitless number of ways an attacker can modify a technology when they are involved in its manufacture, as the attacker has potential inroads to the software composition, hardware design and assembly, firmware, or basic design mechanics. Additionally, manufacturing of key components is often outsourced with the final product assembled by the primary manufacturer. The greatest risk, however, is deliberate manipulation of design specifications to produce malicious hardware or devices.

Many web-based attacks need prior knowledge of the web browser including the version of browser to ensure successful exploitation of a vulnerability. Having this knowledge allows an attacker to target the victim with attacks that specifically exploit known or zero day weaknesses in the type and version of the browser used by the victim. Automating this process via Java Script as a part of the same delivery system used to exploit the browser is considered more efficient as the attacker can supply a browser fingerprinting method and integrate it with exploit code, all contained in Java Script and in response to the same web page request by the browser.","",,Low,"::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:541::","","::Victim's browser visits a website that contains attacker's Java ScriptJava Script is not disabled in the victim's browser::","","","","","::Configuration: Disable Java Script in the browser::","::The following code snippets can be used to detect various browsers: Firefox 2/3 FF=/a/[-1]=='a' Firefox 3 FF3=(function x(){})[-5]=='x' Firefox 2 FF2=(function x(){})[-6]=='x' IE IE='v'=='v' Safari Saf=/a/.__proto__=='//' Chrome Chr=/source/.test((/a/.toString+'')) Opera Op=/^function (/.test([].sort)::","::200::","","",

Windows checks the public key and other curve parameters, but not the (bespoke adversary-supplied) base point generator (G) parameter constant which actually generated the curve [REF-562].
