CVE-2018-12633,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of service and information leakage.","MISC:http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bd23a7269834dc7c1f93e83535d16ebc44b75eba   |   MISC:https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200131   |   MISC:https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bd23a7269834dc7c1f93e83535d16ebc44b75eba",Assigned (20180621),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2018-1272,Candidate,"Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, provide client-side support for multipart requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles.","BID:103697   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103697   |   CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html   |   URL:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html   |   CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html   |   URL:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html   |   CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1272   |   URL:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1272   |   CONFIRM:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:1320   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1320   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:2669   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2669",Assigned (20171206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
