CVE-1999-0523,Red Hat,2007-09-11,Joshua Bressers,"Red Hat Enterprise Linux by default does respond to ICMP echo requests, although itâ€™s likely that in a production environment those would be filtered by some firewall on entry to your network.  However you can happily block ICMP ping responses using iptables if you so wish, but note that there is no known vulnerability in allowing them.

CVE-1999-0997,Red Hat,2006-09-27,Joshua Bressers,"Red Hat does not consider CVE-1999-0997 to be a security vulnerability.  The wu-ftpd process chroots itself into the target ftp directory and will only run external commands as the user logged into the ftp server.  Because the process chroots itself, an attacker needs a valid login with write access to the ftp server, and even then they could only potentially execute commands as themselves."
