CVE-2016-10041,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service Program before 3.43 SP0. Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.","BID:95296   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95296   |   CONFIRM:https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/",Assigned (20161225),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

It is possible to use the pipe character (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the output in the application's responses. Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read, write, and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the application's owner (apache user).","EXPLOIT-DB:41179   |   URL:https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41179/",Assigned (20161226),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2016-10142,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.","BID:95797   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95797   |   CONFIRM:https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA43730   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K57211290?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS   |   MISC:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation-08   |   MISC:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8021   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2017:0817   |   URL:http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0817.html   |   SECTRACK:1038256   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038256",Assigned (20170114),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
