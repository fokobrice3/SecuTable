HP:HPSBUX0107-160 (CVE-2001-1182) states that  |    ""The login(1) command allows restricted shell users to  |    circumvent security checks"" which could be interpreted as  |    meaning that HP has found a slightly less-than-benign aspect  |    of the overflow, but since (a) the advisory says nothing about  |    overflows and (b) the advisory does not include any  |    cross-references, it cannot be clear.  There is a difference  |    in the release dates as well, however, since the HP advisory  |    was released in July 2001 and this CAN was publicized in  |    December 2001, which may be sufficient evidence that the  |    problems are different.  |      |    This probably is not the same issue in login as CVE-2001-0978,  |    since different patches are referenced in that CAN.  |      |    There is insufficient information to know whether this is the  |    same issue as CVE-2001-0094 (kerberos library issues that  |    affect kerberized login)."
