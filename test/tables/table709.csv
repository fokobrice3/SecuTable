CVE-2020-26262,Candidate,"Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6j-r9rf-cm7p   |   URL:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-6g6j-r9rf-cm7p   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-32d0068851   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4CJOPAQT43MYAFU3UROGLEXN3Z6RS4H/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-dee141fc61   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G54UIUFTEC6RLPOISMB6FUW7456SBZC4/   |   MISC:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/57180ab60afcaeb13537e69ae8cb8aefd8f3f546/ChangeLog#L48   |   URL:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/blob/57180ab60afcaeb13537e69ae8cb8aefd8f3f546/ChangeLog#L48   |   MISC:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/abfe1fd08d78baa0947d17dac0f7411c3d948e4d   |   URL:https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/abfe1fd08d78baa0947d17dac0f7411c3d948e4d",Assigned (20201001),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack.

CVE-2020-26278,Candidate,"Weave Net is open source software which creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers across multiple hosts and enables their automatic discovery. Weave Net before version 2.8.0 has a vulnerability in which can allow an attacker to take over any host in the cluster. Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster. This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all other processes on the host, and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting was not necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the hostPID setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container. Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the hostPID line in their existing DaemonSet manifest to say false instead of true, arrange some other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those mounts from the DaemonSet manifest.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/security/advisories/GHSA-pg3p-v8c6-c6h3   |   URL:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/security/advisories/GHSA-pg3p-v8c6-c6h3   |   MISC:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-280   |   URL:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-280   |   MISC:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/commit/a0ac81b3b4cae6d0dcaf3732fd91cedefc89f720   |   URL:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/commit/a0ac81b3b4cae6d0dcaf3732fd91cedefc89f720   |   MISC:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3876   |   URL:https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/pull/3876",Assigned (20201001),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-26281,Candidate,"async-h1 is an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 parser for Rust (crates.io). There is a request smuggling vulnerability in async-h1 before version 2.3.0. This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1 behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications. If the server does not read the body of a request which is longer than some buffer length, async-h1 will attempt to read a subsequent request from the body content starting at that offset into the body. One way to exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to craft a request such that the body contains a request that would not be noticed by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded headers. If an application trusted the authenticity of these headers, it could be misled by the smuggled request. Another potential concern with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending multiple http clients' requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would be possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and capture another user's request in its body. This content could be captured in a post request to an endpoint that allows the content to be subsequently retrieved by the adversary.
