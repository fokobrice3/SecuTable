CVE-2017-9047,Candidate,"A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content->name is written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content->name actually fits also uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write about ""size"" many bytes beyond the allocated memory.

CVE-2017-9106,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adns_rr_info mishandles a bogus *datap. The general pattern for formatting integers is to sprintf into a fixed-size buffer. This is correct if the input is in the right range; if it isn't, the buffer may be overrun (depending on the sizes of the types on the current platform). Of course the inputs ought to be right. And there are pointers in there too, so perhaps one could say that the caller ought to check these things. It may be better to require the caller to make the pointer structure right, but to have the code here be defensive about (and tolerate with an error but without crashing) out-of-range integer values. So: it should defend each of these integer conversion sites with a check for the actual permitted range, and return adns_s_invaliddata if not. The lack of this check causes the SOA sign extension bug to be a serious security problem: the sign extended SOA value is out of range, and overruns the buffer when reconverted.

It would depart the input buffer and start processing many bytes of arbitrary heap data as if it were the query domain. Eventually it would run out of input or find some other kind of error, and declare the query domain invalid. But before then it might outrun available memory and crash. In principle this could be a denial of service attack.","CONFIRM:http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ianmdlvl/git?p=adns.git;a=blob;f=changelog   |   CONFIRM:https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/adns-announce/2020/000004.html   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-530188bf36   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRVHN3GGVNQWAOL3PWC5FLAV7HUESLZR/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-e59bcaf702   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UGFZ4SPV6KFQK6ZNUZFB5Y32OYFOM5YJ/   |   MISC:http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ianmdlvl/git?p=adns.git",Assigned (20170521),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2017-9108,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in adns before 1.5.2. adnshost mishandles a missing final newline on a stdin read. It is wrong to increment used as well as setting r, since used is incremented according to r, later. Rather one should be doing what read() would have done. Without this fix, adnshost may read and process one byte beyond the buffer, perhaps crashing or perhaps somehow leaking the value of that byte.","CONFIRM:http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ianmdlvl/git?p=adns.git;a=blob;f=changelog   |   CONFIRM:https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/adns-announce/2020/000004.html   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-530188bf36   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRVHN3GGVNQWAOL3PWC5FLAV7HUESLZR/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-e59bcaf702   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UGFZ4SPV6KFQK6ZNUZFB5Y32OYFOM5YJ/   |   MISC:http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ianmdlvl/git?p=adns.git",Assigned (20170521),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

It fails to ignore apparent answers before the first RR that was found the first time. when this is fixed, the second answer scan finds the same RRs at the first. Otherwise, adns can be confused by interleaving answers for the CNAME target, with the CNAME itself. In that case the answer data structure (on the heap) can be overrun.
