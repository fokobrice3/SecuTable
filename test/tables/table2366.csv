CVE-2018-11518,Candidate,"A vulnerability allows a phreaking attack on HCL legacy IVR systems that do not use VoIP. These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).","MISC:http://virgil-cj.blogspot.com/2018/05/0day-legacy-ivr-lets-phreak.html   |   MISC:https://datarift.blogspot.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-11518-abusing-ivr-systems.html   |   MISC:https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664204485652482   |   MISC:https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664440759091207",Assigned (20180528),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2018-11567,Candidate,"** DISPUTED ** Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (""gibberish"") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range.
