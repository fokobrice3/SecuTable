CVE-2014-4452,MEDIUM,"WebKit, as used in Apple iOS before 8.1.1 and Apple TV before 7.0.2, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted web site, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-4462."
CVE-2014-4453,MEDIUM,"Apple iOS before 8.1.1 and OS X before 10.10.1 include location data during establishment of a Spotlight Suggestions server connection by Spotlight or Safari, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors."
