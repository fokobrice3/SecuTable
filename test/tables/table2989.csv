CVE-2021-0207,MEDIUM,"An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100% of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0 pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces ""interface"" statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal something similar to: Ingress, first interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up 9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) -------------------- Egress, second interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) -------------------- Dropped packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms.

CVE-2021-0222,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service (DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping. An indication of compromise is to check ""monitor interface traffic"" on the ingress and egress port packet counts. For each ingress packet, two duplicate packets are seen on egress. This issue can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 packets. This issue affects all traffic through the device.

CVE-2021-0291,MEDIUM,"An Exposure of System Data vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, where a sensitive system-level resource is not being sufficiently protected, allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to send specific traffic which partially reaches this resource. A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly increased. The SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance. External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed.

CVE-2021-0293,LOW,"A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS caused by Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime leads to a memory leak each time the CLI command 'show system connections extensive' is executed. The amount of memory leaked on each execution depends on the number of TCP connections from and to the system. Repeated execution will cause more memory to leak and eventually daemons that need to allocate additionally memory and ultimately the kernel to crash, which will result in traffic loss. Continued execution of this command will cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

It will cause storm control not to work hence allowing an attacker to cause high CPU usage or packet loss issues by sending a large amount of broadcast or unknown unicast packets arriving the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX4600, and EX4650, and QFX5100 with QFX 5e Series image installed.

CVE-2021-0295,LOW,"A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on the QFX10K Series switches allows an attacker to trigger a packet forwarding loop, leading to a partial Denial of Service (DoS). The issue is caused by DVMRP packets looping on a multi-homed Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) when VXLAN is configured. DVMRP packets received on a multi-homed ESI are sent to the peer, and then incorrectly forwarded out the same ESI, violating the split horizon rule. This issue only affects QFX10K Series switches, including the QFX10002, QFX10008, and QFX10016. Other products and platforms are unaffected by this vulnerability.
