CVE-2009-1243,Red Hat,2009-04-07,Tomas Hoger,"Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, 5 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG."
CVE-2009-1265,Red Hat,2009-06-17,Tomas Hoger,"This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 4, 5, or Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as the affected driver is not enabled in these kernels.

The affected driver is available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, but only if the kernel-unsupported package is installed.

This issue has been rated as having moderate security impact as it does not lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. As Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 is now in Production 3 of its maintenance life-cycle, http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata, and the affected driver can only be enabled when using the unsupported kernel-unsupported package, a fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates."
