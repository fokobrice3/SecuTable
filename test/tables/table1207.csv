CVE-2022-29210,Candidate,"TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves.

CVE-2022-29219,Candidate,"Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus specification. Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9   |   URL:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9   |   MISC:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3977   |   URL:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3977   |   MISC:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases/tag/v0.36.0   |   URL:https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases/tag/v0.36.0",Assigned (20220413),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-29238,Candidate,"Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully authenticated requests are required, this is of relatively low impact. But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full access to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in information access, only an additional, unintended means by which the files could be accessed.

CVE-2022-29240,Candidate,"Scylla is a real-time big data database that is API-compatible with Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB. When decompressing CQL frame received from user, Scylla assumes that user-provided uncompressed length is correct. If user provides fake length, that is greater than the real one, part of decompression buffer won't be overwritten, and will be left uninitialized. This can be exploited in several ways, depending on the privileges of the user. 1. The main exploit is that an attacker with access to CQL port, but no user account, can bypass authentication, but only if there are other legitimate clients making connections to the cluster, and they use LZ4. 2. Attacker that already has a user account on the cluster can read parts of uninitialized memory, which can contain things like passwords of other users or fragments of other queries / results, which leads to authorization bypass and sensitive information disclosure.

CVE-2022-2928,Candidate,"In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1, when the function option_code_hash_lookup() is called from add_option(), it increases the option's refcount field. However, there is not a corresponding call to option_dereference() to decrement the refcount field. The function add_option() is only used in server responses to lease query packets. Each lease query response calls this function for several options, so eventually, the reference counters could overflow and cause the server to abort.","CONFIRM:https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2022-2928   |   URL:https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2022-2928   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-9ca9a94e28   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T6IBFH4MRRNJQVWEKILQ6I6CXWW766FX/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-c4f274a54f   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2SARIK7KZ7MGQIWDRWZFAOSQSPXY4GOU/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-f5a45757df   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QQXYCIWUDILRCNBAIMVFCSGXBRKEPB4K/   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20221010 [SECURITY] [DLA 3146-1] isc-dhcp security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00015.html",Assigned (20220822),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
