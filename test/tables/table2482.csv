CVE-2001-0935,Red Hat,2006-09-27,Joshua Bressers,"CVE-2001-0935 refers to vulnerabilities found when SUSE did a code audit of the wu-ftpd glob.c file in wu-ftpd 2.6.0. They shared these details with the wu-ftpd upstream authors who clarified that some of the issues did not apply, and all were addressed by the version of glob.c in upstream wu-ftpd 2.6.1. Therefore we believe that the issues labelled as CVE-2001-0935 do not affect wu-ftpd 2.6.1 or later versions and therefore do not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1."
CVE-2001-0983,UltraEdit,2012-03-06,UltraEdit,"We include an option, by design, that allows the user to *not* save the password, and instead enter the password on a per FTP session basis.  This would provide the highest level of security.  If the user decides to have UltraEdit save the FTP password in the INI, it is encrypted for the benefit of the user moving their settings from one system to another.  However, even with the highest level of encryption of the saved password, if the user decides to save their password in the INI, there will always be a level of vulnerability as a result of the users decision to save the password."
