CVE-2007-4766,HIGH,Multiple integer overflows in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via unspecified escape (backslash) sequences.
CVE-2007-4767,MEDIUM,"Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 does not properly compute the length of (1) a \p sequence, (2) a \P sequence, or (3) a \P{x} sequence, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop or crash) or execute arbitrary code."
CVE-2007-4768,MEDIUM,"Heap-based buffer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a singleton Unicode sequence in a character class in a regex pattern, which is incorrectly optimized."
CVE-2007-4769,MEDIUM,"The regular expression parser in TCL before 8.4.17, as used in PostgreSQL 8.2 before 8.2.6, 8.1 before 8.1.11, 8.0 before 8.0.15, and 7.4 before 7.4.19, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (backend crash) via an out-of-bounds backref number."
CVE-2007-4770,MEDIUM,"libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier attempts to process backreferences to the nonexistent capture group zero (aka \0), which might allow context-dependent attackers to read from, or write to, out-of-bounds memory locations, related to corruption of REStackFrames."
CVE-2007-4771,HIGH,Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to the backtracking stack.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
CVE-2007-4772,MEDIUM,"The regular expression parser in TCL before 8.4.17, as used in PostgreSQL 8.2 before 8.2.6, 8.1 before 8.1.11, 8.0 before 8.0.15, and 7.4 before 7.4.19, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted regular expression."
CVE-2007-4773,HIGH,Systrace before 1.6.0 has insufficient escape policy enforcement.
CVE-2007-4774,MEDIUM,"The Linux kernel before 2.4.36-rc1 has a race condition. It was possible to bypass systrace policies by flooding the ptraced process with SIGCONT signals, which can can wake up a PTRACED process."
CVE-2007-4776,HIGH,"Buffer overflow in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and Enterprise Edition 6.0 SP6 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Visual Basic project (vbp) file containing a long Reference line, related to VBP_Open and OLE. NOTE: there are limited usage scenarios under which this would be a vulnerability."
CVE-2007-4777,HIGH,"SQL injection vulnerability in Joomla! 1.5 before RC2 (aka Endeleo) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors, probably related to the archive section.  NOTE: this may be the same as CVE-2007-4778."
CVE-2007-4778,HIGH,"Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the content component (com_content) in Joomla! 1.5 Beta1, Beta2, and RC1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the filter parameter in an archive action to (1) archive.php, (2) category.php, or (3) section.php in models/.  NOTE: this may be the same as CVE-2007-4777."
CVE-2007-4779,MEDIUM,"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Joomla! 1.5 before RC2 (aka Endeleo) allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors, probably related to the archive section."
CVE-2007-4780,MEDIUM,"Joomla! 1.5 before RC2 (aka Endeleo) allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (the full path) via unspecified vectors, probably involving direct requests to certain PHP scripts in tmpl/ directories."
CVE-2007-4781,MEDIUM,"administrator/index.php in the installer component (com_installer) in Joomla! 1.5 Beta1, Beta2, and RC1 allows remote authenticated administrators to upload arbitrary files to tmp/ via the ""Upload Package File"" functionality, which is accessible when com_installer is the value of the option parameter."
