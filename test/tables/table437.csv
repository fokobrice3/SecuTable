CVE-2019-1802,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a report containing malicious content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions 6.2.3, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 are affected.","BID:107995   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107995   |   CISCO:20190417 Cisco Firepower Management Center Persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-cfmc-xss",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-1810,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature used in an NX-OS CLI command in Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software image on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because software digital signatures are not properly verified during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to install an unsigned software image on an affected device. Note: If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.","BID:108431   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108431   |   CISCO:20190515 Cisco Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS Mode CLI Command Software Image Signature Verification Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-sisv",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
