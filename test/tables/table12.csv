197,Numeric Truncation Error,Base,Incomplete,Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.,"When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1305:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:681:VIEW ID:1340:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:195:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:196:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:192:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanAlsoBe:CWE ID:194:VIEW ID:1000::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:C#:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Implementation::,,,::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:NOTE:The true value of the data is lost and corrupted data is used.::,,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Ensure that no casts, implicit or explicit, take place that move from a larger size primitive or a smaller size primitive.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-17087:DESCRIPTION:Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-17087::REFERENCE:CVE-2009-0231:DESCRIPTION:Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0231::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-3282:DESCRIPTION:Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-3282::",,,::TAXONOMY NAME:PLOVER:ENTRY NAME:Numeric truncation error::TAXONOMY NAME:CLASP:ENTRY NAME:Truncation error::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FIO34-C:ENTRY NAME:Distinguish between characters read from a file and EOF or WEOF:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:FLP34-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that floating point conversions are within range of the new type:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT02-C:ENTRY NAME:Understand integer conversion rules::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT05-C:ENTRY NAME:Do not use input functions to convert character data if they cannot handle all possible inputs::TAXONOMY NAME:CERT C Secure Coding:ENTRY ID:INT31-C:ENTRY NAME:Ensure that integer conversions do not result in lost or misinterpreted data:MAPPING FIT:CWE More Abstract::TAXONOMY NAME:The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java (2011):ENTRY ID:NUM12-J:ENTRY NAME:Ensure conversions of numeric types to narrower types do not result in lost or misinterpreted data::TAXONOMY NAME:Software Fault Patterns:ENTRY ID:SFP1:ENTRY NAME:Glitch in computation::,,"::TYPE:Research Gap:NOTE:This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.::"
209,Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,"The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.","The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways: self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of .. sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:755:VIEW ID:1000::,::ORDINALITY:Primary::ORDINALITY:Resultant::,::LANGUAGE NAME:PHP:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Often::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:System Configuration::PHASE:Operation::,,,::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:Often this will either reveal sensitive information which may be used for a later attack or private information stored in the server.::,"::METHOD:Manual Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness generally requires domain-specific interpretation using manual analysis.

For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS.

Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success. If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.

362,Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),Class,Draft,"The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.","This can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or modifying important state information that should not be influenced by an outsider. A race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc. A race condition violates these properties, which are closely related: Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution. Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource. A race condition exists when an interfering code sequence can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity. Programmers may assume that certain code sequences execute too quickly to be affected by an interfering code sequence; when they are not, this violates atomicity. For example, the single x++ statement may appear atomic at the code layer, but it is actually non-atomic at the instruction layer, since it involves a read (the original value of x), followed by a computation (x+1), followed by a write (save the result to x). The interfering code sequence could be trusted or untrusted. A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:691:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:C:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::LANGUAGE NAME:C++:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Sometimes::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Mobile:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,,,::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):NOTE:When a race condition makes it possible to bypass a resource cleanup routine or trigger multiple initialization routines, it may lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-400).::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:NOTE:When a race condition allows multiple control flows to access a resource simultaneously, it might lead the product(s) into unexpected states, possibly resulting in a crash.::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:IMPACT:Read Application Data:NOTE:When a race condition is combined with predictable resource names and loose permissions, it may be possible for an attacker to overwrite or access confidential data (CWE-59).::","::METHOD:Black Box:DESCRIPTION:Black box methods may be able to identify evidence of race conditions via methods such as multiple simultaneous connections, which may cause the software to become instable or crash.
