CVE-2022-3215,Candidate,"NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and ""inject"" those newlines into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type, ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable, all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.","MISC:https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/security/advisories/GHSA-7fj7-39wj-c64f   |   URL:https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/security/advisories/GHSA-7fj7-39wj-c64f",Assigned (20220914),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-32221,Candidate,"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230110-0006/   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230208-0002/   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213604   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213605   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5330   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5330   |   FULLDISC:20230123 APPLE-SA-2023-01-23-4 macOS Ventura 13.2   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/19   |   FULLDISC:20230123 APPLE-SA-2023-01-23-5 macOS Monterey 12.6.3   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/20   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202212-01   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01   |   MISC:https://hackerone.com/reports/1704017   |   URL:https://hackerone.com/reports/1704017   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20230128 [SECURITY] [DLA 3288-1] curl security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00028.html",Assigned (20220601),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
