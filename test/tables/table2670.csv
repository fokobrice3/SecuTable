CVE-2014-7924,MEDIUM,"Use-after-free vulnerability in the IndexedDB implementation in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering duplicate BLOB references, related to content/browser/indexed_db/indexed_db_callbacks.cc and content/browser/indexed_db/indexed_db_dispatcher_host.cc."
CVE-2014-7925,HIGH,"Use-after-free vulnerability in the WebAudio implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an audio-rendering thread in which AudioNode data is improperly maintained."
CVE-2014-7926,HIGH,"The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 before SVN revision 292944, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to a zero-length quantifier."

CVE-2014-7928,HIGH,"hydrogen.cc in Google V8, as used Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not properly handle arrays with holes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that triggers an array copy."
CVE-2014-7929,HIGH,"Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTMLScriptElement::didMoveToNewDocument function in core/html/HTMLScriptElement.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving movement of a SCRIPT element across documents."
CVE-2014-7930,HIGH,"Use-after-free vulnerability in core/events/TreeScopeEventContext.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code that triggers improper maintenance of TreeScope data."
