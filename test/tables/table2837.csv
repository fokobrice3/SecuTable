CVE-2018-19960,MEDIUM,"The debug_mode function in web/web.py in OnionShare through 1.3.1, when --debug is enabled, uses the /tmp/onionshare_server.log pathname for logging, which might allow local users to overwrite files or obtain sensitive information by using this pathname."
CVE-2018-19961,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x on AMD x86 platforms, possibly allowing guest OS users to gain host OS privileges because TLB flushes do not always occur after IOMMU mapping changes."
CVE-2018-19962,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x on AMD x86 platforms, possibly allowing guest OS users to gain host OS privileges because small IOMMU mappings are unsafely combined into larger ones."

CVE-2018-19981,HIGH,"Amazon AWS SDK <=2.8.5 for Android uses Android SharedPreferences to store plain text AWS STS Temporary Credentials retrieved by AWS Cognito Identity Service. An attacker can use these credentials to create authenticated and/or authorized requests. Note that the attacker must have ""root"" privilege access to the Android filesystem in order to exploit this vulnerability (i.e. the device has been compromised, such as disabling or bypassing Android's fundamental security mechanisms)."
CVE-2018-19982,LOW,"An issue was discovered on KT MC01507L Z-Wave S0 devices. It occurs because HPKP is not implemented. The communication architecture is APP > Server > Controller (HUB) > Node (products which are controlled by HUB). The prerequisite is that the attacker is on the same network as the target HUB, and can use IP Changer to change destination IP addresses (of all packets whose destination IP address is Server) to a proxy-server IP address. This allows sniffing of cleartext between Server and Controller. The cleartext command data is transmitted to Controller using the proxy server's fake certificate, and it is able to control each Node of the HUB. Also, by operating HUB in Z-Wave Pairing Mode, it is possible to obtain the Z-Wave network key."
CVE-2018-19983,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered on Sigma Design Z-Wave S0 through S2 devices. An attacker first prepares a Z-Wave frame-transmission program (e.g., Z-Wave PC Controller, OpenZWave, CC1110, etc.). Next, the attacker conducts a DoS attack against the Z-Wave S0 Security version product by continuously sending divided ""Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)"" frames. The reason for dividing the ""Nonce Get"" frame is that, in security version S0, when a node receives a ""Nonce Get"" frame, the node produces a random new nonce and sends it to the Src node of the received ""Nonce Get"" frame. After the nonce value is generated and transmitted, the node transitions to wait mode. At this time, when ""Nonce Get"" is received again, the node discards the previous nonce value and generates a random nonce again. Therefore, because the frame is encrypted with previous nonce value, the received normal frame cannot be decrypted."
CVE-2018-19985,LOW,"The function hso_get_config_data in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space."
