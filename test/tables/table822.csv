CVE-2021-0207,Candidate,"An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN. This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100% of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0 pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces ""interface"" statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal something similar to: Ingress, first interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up 9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) -------------------- Egress, second interface: -------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) -------------------- Dropped packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms.

Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain the partial DoS. The overlayd daemon handles Overlay OAM packets, such as ping and traceroute, sent to the overlay. The service runs as root by default and listens for UDP connections on port 4789. This issue results from improper buffer size validation, which can lead to a buffer overflow. Unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted packets to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in possible remote code execution. overlayd runs by default in MX Series, ACX Series, and QFX Series platforms.
