CVE-2017-15705,Candidate,"A denial of service vulnerability was identified that exists in Apache SpamAssassin before 3.4.2. The vulnerability arises with certain unclosed tags in emails that cause markup to be handled incorrectly leading to scan timeouts. In Apache SpamAssassin, using HTML::Parser, we setup an object and hook into the begin and end tag event handlers In both cases, the ""open"" event is immediately followed by a ""close"" event - even if the tag *does not* close in the HTML being parsed. Because of this, we are missing the ""text"" event to deal with the object normally. This can cause carefully crafted emails that might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of Service. The issue is possibly a bug or design decision in HTML::Parser that specifically impacts the way Apache SpamAssassin uses the module with poorly formed html. The exploit has been seen in the wild but not believed to have been purposefully part of a Denial of Service attempt.

The update was not correct. As a result, some scripts may have failed to execute as expected and other scripts may have been executed unexpectedly. Note that the behaviour of the CGI servlet has remained unchanged in this regard. It is only the documentation of the behaviour that was wrong and has been corrected.","BID:103069   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103069   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   MLIST:[announce] 20180131 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-15706 Apache Tomcat Incorrectly documented CGI search algorithm   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e1ef853fc0079cdb55befbd2dac042934e49288b476d5f6a649e5da2@%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190319 svn commit: r1855831 [24/30] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: ./ docs/ xdocs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/eb6efa8d59c45a7a9eff94c4b925467d3b3fec8ba7697f3daa314b04@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190319 svn commit: r1855831 [25/30] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: ./ docs/ xdocs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/343558d982879bf88ec20dbf707f8c11255f8e219e81d45c4f8d0551@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190325 svn commit: r1856174 [22/29] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/388a323769f1dff84c9ec905455aa73fbcb20338e3c7eb131457f708@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190325 svn commit: r1856174 [23/29] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5c0e00fd31efc11e147bf99d0f03c00a734447d3b131ab0818644cdb@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190325 svn commit: r1856174 [24/29] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b5e3f51d28cd5d9b1809f56594f2cf63dcd6a90429e16ea9f83bbedc@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190413 svn commit: r1857494 [16/20] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: ./ docs/ xdocs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/845312a10aabbe2c499fca94003881d2c79fc993d85f34c1f5c77424@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190413 svn commit: r1857494 [17/20] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: ./ docs/ xdocs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/88855876c33f2f9c532ffb75bfee570ccf0b17ffa77493745af9a17a@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190413 svn commit: r1857496 [3/4] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: ./ docs/ xdocs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e85e83e9954f169bbb77b44baae5a33d8de878df557bb32b7f793661@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190415 svn commit: r1857582 [17/22] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3d19773b4cf0377db62d1e9328bf9160bf1819f04f988315086931d7@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190415 svn commit: r1857582 [18/22] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/1dd0a59c1295cc08ce4c9e7edae5ad2268acc9ba55adcefa0532e5ba@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190415 svn commit: r1857582 [19/22] - in /tomcat/site/trunk: docs/ xdocs/stylesheets/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6af47120905aa7d8fe12f42e8ff2284fb338ba141d3b77b8c7cb61b3@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20200203 svn commit: r1873527 [24/30] - /tomcat/site/trunk/docs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6ccee4e849bc77df0840c7f853f6bd09d426f6741247da2b7429d5d9@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20200203 svn commit: r1873527 [25/30] - /tomcat/site/trunk/docs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r3bbb800a816d0a51eccc5a228c58736960a9fffafa581a225834d97d@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20200213 svn commit: r1873980 [27/34] - /tomcat/site/trunk/docs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9136ff5b13e4f1941360b5a309efee2c114a14855578c3a2cbe5d19c@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20200213 svn commit: r1873980 [28/34] - /tomcat/site/trunk/docs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/raba0fabaf4d56d4325ab2aca8814f0b30a237ab83d8106b115ee279a@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20200213 svn commit: r1873980 [29/34] - /tomcat/site/trunk/docs/   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r48c1444845fe15a823e1374674bfc297d5008a5453788099ea14caf0@%3Cdev.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   UBUNTU:USN-3665-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3665-1/",Assigned (20171021),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2017-15708,Candidate,"In Apache Synapse, by default no authentication is required for Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So Apache Synapse 3.0.1 or all previous releases (3.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.0, 1.2, 1.1.2, 1.1.1) allows remote code execution attacks that can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence of Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar) or previous versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate the issue, we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. Further upgrading to 3.0.1 version will eliminate the risk of having said Commons Collection version. In Synapse 3.0.1, Commons Collection has been updated to 3.2.2 version.","BID:102154   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102154   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202107-37   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-37   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MLIST:[dev] 20171210 [CVE-2017-15708] Apache Synapse Remote Code Execution Vulnerability   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/77f2accf240d25d91b47033e2f8ebec84ffbc6e6627112b2f98b66c9@%3Cdev.synapse.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[doris-commits] 20210402 [GitHub] [incubator-doris] zh0122 opened a new pull request #5595: [FE][Fix]Update commons-collections to fix a security issue   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0fb289cd38c915b9a13a3376134f96222dd9100f1ef66b41631865c6@%3Ccommits.doris.apache.org%3E",Assigned (20171021),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
