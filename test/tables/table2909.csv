CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2019-5634,LOW,"An inclusion of sensitive information in log files vulnerability is present in Hickory Smart for Android mobile devices from Belwith Products, LLC. Communications to the internet API services and direct connections to the lock via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) from the mobile application are logged in a debug log on the Android device at HickorySmartLog/Logs/SRDeviceLog.txt. This information was found stored in the Android device's default USB or SDcard storage paths and is accessible without rooting the device. This issue affects Hickory Smart for Android, version 01.01.43 and prior versions."
CVE-2019-5635,MEDIUM,"A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability is present in Hickory Smart Ethernet Bridge from Belwith Products, LLC. Captured data reveals that the Hickory Smart Ethernet Bridge device communicates over the network to an MQTT broker without using encryption. This exposed the default username and password used to authenticate to the MQTT broker. This issue affects Hickory Smart Ethernet Bridge, model number H077646. The firmware does not appear to contain versioning information."
CVE-2019-5636,MEDIUM,"When a Beckhoff TwinCAT Runtime receives a malformed UDP packet, the ADS Discovery Service shuts down. Note that the TwinCAT devices are still performing as normal. This issue affects TwinCAT 2 version 2304 (and prior) and TwinCAT 3.1 version 4204.0 (and prior)."

CVE-2019-5647,LOW,"The Chrome Plugin for Rapid7 AppSpider can incorrectly keep browser sessions active after recording a macro, even after a restart of the Chrome browser. This behavior could make future session hijacking attempts easier, since the user could believe a session was closed when it was not. This issue affects Rapid7 AppSpider version 3.8.213 and prior versions, and is fixed in version 3.8.215."
CVE-2019-5648,MEDIUM,"Authenticated, administrative access to a Barracuda Load Balancer ADC running unpatched firmware <= v6.4 allows one to edit the LDAP service configuration of the balancer and change the LDAP server to an attacker-controlled system, without having to re-enter LDAP credentials. These steps can be used by any authenticated administrative user to expose the LDAP credentials configured in the LDAP connector over the network."
