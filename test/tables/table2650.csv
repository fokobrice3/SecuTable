CVE-2014-1564,MEDIUM,"Mozilla Firefox before 32.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.1, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.1 do not properly initialize memory for GIF rendering, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted web script that interacts with a CANVAS element associated with a malformed GIF image."
CVE-2014-1565,MEDIUM,"The mozilla::dom::AudioEventTimeline function in the Web Audio API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.1, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.1 does not properly create audio timelines, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted API calls."
CVE-2014-1566,MEDIUM,"Mozilla Firefox before 31.1 on Android does not properly restrict copying of local files onto the SD card during processing of file: URLs, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from the Firefox profile directory via a crafted application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-1515."
CVE-2014-1567,HIGH,"Use-after-free vulnerability in DirectionalityUtils.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0, Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.8 and 31.x before 31.1, and Thunderbird 24.x before 24.8 and 31.x before 31.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via text that is improperly handled during the interaction between directionality resolution and layout."
CVE-2014-1568,HIGH,"Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.16.2.1, 3.16.x before 3.16.5, and 3.17.x before 3.17.1, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 32.0.3, Mozilla Firefox ESR 24.x before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.1, Mozilla Thunderbird before 24.8.1 and 31.x before 31.1.2, Mozilla SeaMonkey before 2.29.1, Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.124 on Windows and OS X, and Google Chrome OS before 37.0.2062.120, does not properly parse ASN.1 values in X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof RSA signatures via a crafted certificate, aka a ""signature malleability"" issue."
CVE-2014-1569,HIGH,"The definite_length_decoder function in lib/util/quickder.c in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.16.2.4 and 3.17.x before 3.17.3 does not ensure that the DER encoding of an ASN.1 length is properly formed, which allows remote attackers to conduct data-smuggling attacks by using a long byte sequence for an encoding, as demonstrated by the SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem function's improper handling of an arbitrary-length encoding of 0x00."
CVE-2014-1571,MEDIUM,"Bugzilla 2.x through 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.11, 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4.6, and 4.5.x before 4.5.6 allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive private-comment information by leveraging a role as a flag recipient, related to Bug.pm, Flag.pm, and a mail template."
CVE-2014-1572,MEDIUM,"The confirm_create_account function in the account-creation feature in token.cgi in Bugzilla 2.x through 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.11, 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4.6, and 4.5.x before 4.5.6 does not specify a scalar context for the realname parameter, which allows remote attackers to create accounts with unverified e-mail addresses by sending three realname values with realname=login_name as the second, as demonstrated by selecting an e-mail address with a domain name for which group privileges are automatically granted."
CVE-2014-1573,MEDIUM,"Bugzilla 2.x through 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x and 4.2.x before 4.2.11, 4.3.x and 4.4.x before 4.4.6, and 4.5.x before 4.5.6 does not ensure that a scalar context is used for certain CGI parameters, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sending three values for a single parameter name."
CVE-2014-1574,HIGH,"Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors."
CVE-2014-1575,HIGH,"Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to improper interaction between threading and garbage collection in the GCRuntime::triggerGC function in js/src/jsgc.cpp, and unknown other vectors."
