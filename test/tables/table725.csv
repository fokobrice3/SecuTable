CVE-2020-28041,Candidate,"The SIP ALG implementation on NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 1.0.9.64_10.2.64 devices allows remote attackers to communicate with arbitrary TCP and UDP services on a victim's intranet machine, if the victim visits an attacker-controlled web site with a modern browser, aka NAT Slipstreaming. This occurs because the ALG takes action based on an IP packet with an initial REGISTER substring in the TCP data, and the correct intranet IP address in the subsequent Via header, without properly considering that connection progress and fragmentation affect the meaning of the packet data.","CONFIRM:https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2020-0024   |   MISC:https://github.com/samyk/slipstream   |   MISC:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24956616   |   MISC:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24958281   |   MISC:https://samy.pl/slipstream/",Assigned (20201101),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-28049,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts the X server in a way that - for a short time period - allows local unprivileged users to create a connection to the X server without providing proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access X server display contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or access the clipboard. This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority file creation.","DEBIAN:DSA-4783   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4783   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-7066b95c99   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GT3EX5NSQJJAKY63ENSMEDX6NYZLYY3S/   |   MISC:https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-28049   |   MISC:https://github.com/sddm/sddm/blob/v0.19.0/ChangeLog   |   MISC:https://github.com/sddm/sddm/releases   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20201106 [SECURITY] [DLA 2436-1] sddm security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/11/msg00009.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:1870   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00031.html",Assigned (20201102),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
