97,"Cryptanalysis",Standard,Draft,"Cryptanalysis is a process of finding weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms and using these weaknesses to decipher the ciphertext without knowing the secret key (instance deduction). Sometimes the weakness is not in the cryptographic algorithm itself, but rather in how it is applied that makes cryptanalysis successful. An attacker may have other goals as well, such as: Total Break (finding the secret key), Global Deduction (finding a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption that does not require knowledge of the secret key), Information Deduction (gaining some information about plaintexts or ciphertexts that was not previously known) and Distinguishing Algorithm (the attacker has the ability to distinguish the output of the encryption (ciphertext) from a random permutation of bits).","",Low,Very High,"::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:192::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:20::","::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:An attacker discovers a weakness in the cryptographic algorithm or a weakness in how it was applied to a particular chunk of plaintext.::STEP:2:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:An attacker leverages the discovered weakness to decrypt, partially decrypt or infer some information about the contents of the encrypted message. All of that is done without knowing the secret key.::","::The target software utilizes some sort of cryptographic algorithm.::An underlying weaknesses exists either in the cryptographic algorithm used or in the way that it was applied to a particular chunk of plaintext.::The encryption algorithm is known to the attacker.::An attacker has access to the ciphertext.::","::SKILL:Cryptanalysis generally requires a very significant level of understanding of mathematics and computation.:LEVEL:High::","::Computing resource requirements will vary based on the complexity of a given cryptanalysis technique. Access to the encryption/decryption routines of the algorithm is also required.::","","::SCOPE:Confidentiality:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Read Data:NOTE:In most cases, if cryptanalysis is successful at all, an adversary will not be able to decrypt the entire message, but instead will only be able to deduce some information about the plaintext. However, that may be sufficient for an adversary, depending on the context of the attack.::","::Use proven cryptographic algorithms with recommended key sizes.::Ensure that the algorithms are used properly. That means: 1. Not rolling out your own crypto; Use proven algorithms and implementations. 2. Choosing initialization vectors with sufficiently random numbers 3. Generating key material using good sources of randomness and avoiding known weak keys 4. Using proven protocols and their implementations. 5. Picking the most appropriate cryptographic algorithm for your usage context and data::","::A very easy to understand example is a cryptanalysis technique called frequency analysis that can be successfully applied to the very basic classic encryption algorithms that performed mono-alphabetic substitution replacing each letter in the plaintext with its predetermined mapping letter from the same alphabet. This was considered an improvement over a more basic technique that would simply shift all of the letters of the plaintext by some constant number of positions and replace the original letters with the new letter with the resultant alphabet position. While mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers are resilient to blind brute force, they can be broken easily with nothing more than a pen and paper. Frequency analysis uses the fact that natural language is not random and mono-alphabetic substitution does not hide the statistical properties of the natural language. So if the letter E in an English language occurs with a certain known frequency (about 12.7%), whatever E was substituted with to get to the ciphertext, will occur with the similar frequency. Having this frequency information allows the cryptanalyst to quickly determine the substitutions and decipher the ciphertext. Frequency analysis techniques are not applicable to modern ciphers as they are all resilient to it (unless this is a very bad case of a homegrown encryption algorithm). This example is inapplicable to modern cryptographic ciphers but is here to illustrate a rudimentary example of cryptanalysis.::","::327::1204::1240::1241::1279::","TAXONOMY NAME:OWASP Attacks:ENTRY NAME:Cryptanalysis::","",
98,"Phishing",Standard,Draft,"Phishing is a social engineering technique where an attacker masquerades as a legitimate entity with which the victim might do business in order to prompt the user to reveal some confidential information (very frequently authentication credentials) that can later be used by an attacker. Phishing is essentially a form of information gathering or fishing for information.","",High,Very High,"::NATURE:ChildOf:CAPEC ID:151::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:89::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:543::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:611::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:630::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:631::NATURE:CanPrecede:CAPEC ID:632::","::STEP:1:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Obtain domain name and certificate to spoof legitimate site] This optional step can be used to help the attacker impersonate the legitimate site more convincingly. The attacker can use homograph attacks to convince users that they are using the legitimate website. Note that this step is not required for phishing attacks, and many phishing attacks simply supply URLs containing an IP address and no SSL certificate.:TECHNIQUE:Optionally obtain a domain name that visually looks similar to the legitimate site's domain name. An example is www.paypaI.com vs. www.paypal.com (the first one contains a capital i, instead of a lower case L):TECHNIQUE:Optionally obtain a legitimate SSL certificate for the new domain name.::STEP:2:PHASE:Explore:DESCRIPTION:[Explore legitimate website and create duplicate] An attacker creates a website (optionally at a URL that looks similar to the original URL) that closely resembles the website that they are trying to impersonate. That website will typically have a login form for the victim to put in their authentication credentials. There can be different variations on a theme here.:TECHNIQUE:Use spidering software to get copy of web pages on legitimate site.:TECHNIQUE:Manually save copies of required web pages from legitimate site.:TECHNIQUE:Create new web pages that have the legitimate site's look and feel, but contain completely new content.::STEP:3:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Convince user to enter sensitive information on attacker's site.] An attacker sends an e-mail to the victim that has some sort of a call to action to get the user to click on the link included in the e-mail (which takes the victim to attacker's website) and log in. The key is to get the victim to believe that the e-mail is coming from a legitimate entity with which the victim does business and that the website pointed to by the URL in the e-mail is the legitimate website. A call to action will usually need to sound legitimate and urgent enough to prompt action from the user.:TECHNIQUE:Send the user a message from a spoofed legitimate-looking e-mail address that asks the user to click on the included link.:TECHNIQUE:Place phishing link in post to online forum.::STEP:4:PHASE:Exploit:DESCRIPTION:[Use stolen credentials to log into legitimate site] Once the attacker captures some sensitive information through phishing (login credentials, credit card information, etc.) the attacker can leverage this information. For instance, the attacker can use the victim's login credentials to log into their bank account and transfer money to an account of their choice.:TECHNIQUE:Log in to the legitimate site using another user's supplied credentials::","::An attacker needs to have a way to initiate contact with the victim.

The link in the e-mail looks very similar to that of their bank and once the link is clicked, the log in page is the exact replica. The target supplies their login credentials after which they are notified that their account has now been unlocked and that everything is fine. An attacker has just collected the target's online banking information which can now be used by the attacker to log into the target's bank account and transfer money to a bank account of the attackers' choice.::An adversary may use BlueJacking, or Bluetooth Phishing to send unsolicited contact cards, messages, or pictures to nearby devices that are listening via Bluetooth.
