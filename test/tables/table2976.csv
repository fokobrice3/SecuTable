CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2020-5419,MEDIUM,RabbitMQ versions 3.8.x prior to 3.8.7 are prone to a Windows-specific binary planting security vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution. An attacker with write privileges to the RabbitMQ installation directory and local access on Windows could carry out a local binary hijacking (planting) attack and execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2020-5420,MEDIUM,"Cloud Foundry Routing (Gorouter) versions prior to 0.206.0 allow a malicious developer with ""cf push"" access to cause denial-of-service to the CF cluster by pushing an app that returns specially crafted HTTP responses that crash the Gorouters."
CVE-2020-5421,LOW,"In Spring Framework versions 5.2.0 - 5.2.8, 5.1.0 - 5.1.17, 5.0.0 - 5.0.18, 4.3.0 - 4.3.28, and older unsupported versions, the protections against RFD attacks from CVE-2015-5211 may be bypassed depending on the browser used through the use of a jsessionid path parameter."
CVE-2020-5422,MEDIUM,BOSH System Metrics Server releases prior to 0.1.0 exposed the UAA password as a flag to a process running on the BOSH director. It exposed the password to any user or process with access to the same VM (through ps or looking at process details).
CVE-2020-5423,HIGH,"CAPI (Cloud Controller) versions prior to 1.101.0 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack in which an unauthenticated malicious attacker can send specially-crafted YAML files to certain endpoints, causing the YAML parser to consume excessive CPU and RAM."

CVE-2020-5425,MEDIUM,"Single Sign-On for Vmware Tanzu all versions prior to 1.11.3 ,1.12.x versions prior to 1.12.4 and 1.13.x prior to 1.13.1 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack.If two users are logged in to the SSO operator dashboard at the same time, with the same username, from two different identity providers, one can acquire the token of the other and thus operate with their permissions. Note: Foundation may be vulnerable only if: 1) The system zone is set up to use a SAML identity provider 2) There are internal users that have the same username as users in the external SAML provider 3) Those duplicate-named users have the scope to access the SSO operator dashboard 4) The vulnerability doesn't appear with LDAP because of chained authentication."
CVE-2020-5426,MEDIUM,Scheduler for TAS prior to version 1.4.0 was permitting plaintext transmission of UAA client token by sending it over a non-TLS connection. This also depended on the configuration of the MySQL server which is used to cache a UAA client token used by the service. If intercepted the token can give an attacker admin level access in the cloud controller.

CVE-2020-5763,HIGH,Grandstream HT800 series firmware version 1.0.17.5 and below contain a backdoor in the SSH service. An authenticated remote attacker can obtain a root shell by correctly answering a challenge prompt.
CVE-2020-5764,MEDIUM,"MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in ""Receive"" mode. An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a ""sender"" and sending a MessageType of ""FILE_LIST"" with a ""name"" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended ""/sdcard/MXshare"" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing "".odex"" and "".vdex"" files in the ""oat"" directory of the MX Player application."
CVE-2020-5765,LOW,"Nessus 8.10.0 and earlier were found to contain a Stored XSS vulnerability due to improper validation of input during scan configuration.

CVE-2020-5774,LOW,Nessus versions 8.11.0 and earlier were found to maintain sessions longer than the permitted period in certain scenarios. The lack of proper session expiration could allow attackers with local access to login into an existing browser session.
CVE-2020-5775,MEDIUM,"Server-Side Request Forgery in Canvas LMS 2020-07-29 allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause the Canvas application to perform HTTP GET requests to arbitrary domains."
CVE-2020-5776,MEDIUM,"Currently, all versions of MAGMI are vulnerable to CSRF due to the lack of CSRF tokens. RCE (via phpcli command) is possible in the event that a CSRF is leveraged against an existing admin session for MAGMI."
CVE-2020-5777,HIGH,"MAGMI versions prior to 0.7.24 are vulnerable to a remote authentication bypass due to allowing default credentials in the event there is a database connection failure. A remote attacker can trigger this connection failure if the Mysql setting max_connections (default 151) is lower than Apache (or another web server) setting MaxRequestWorkers (formerly MaxClients) (default 256). This can be done by sending at least 151 simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a ""Too many connections"" error, then use default magmi:magmi basic authentication to remotely bypass authentication."
CVE-2020-5778,MEDIUM,"A flaw exists in Trading Technologies Messaging 7.1.28.3 (ttmd.exe) due to improper validation of user-supplied data when processing a type 8 message sent to default TCP RequestPort 10200. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this issue, via a specially crafted message, to terminate ttmd.exe."
CVE-2020-5779,MEDIUM,"A flaw in Trading Technologies Messaging 7.1.28.3 (ttmd.exe) relates to invalid parameter handling when calling strcpy_s() with an invalid parameter (i.e., a long src string parameter) as a part of processing a type 4 message sent to default TCP RequestPort 10200. It's been observed that ttmd.exe terminates as a result."
