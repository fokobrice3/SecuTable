CVE-2020-11710,Candidate,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. &#8220;1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating &#8216;An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.&#8217; is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a &#8220;Patch&#8221; link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing.
