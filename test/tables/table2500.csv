CVE-2007-4465,Red Hat,2007-09-18,Mark J Cox,"This is actually a flaw in browsers that do not derive the response character set as required by RFC 2616. This does not affect the default configuration of Apache httpd in Red Hat products and will only affect customers who have removed the &quot;AddDefaultCharset&quot; directive and are using directory indexes.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.
