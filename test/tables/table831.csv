CVE-2021-1155,Candidate,"Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.","CISCO:20210113 Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-LPTQ3EQC",Assigned (20201113),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
