However, the  |    poster also said that they had notified Trend on June 11.  |    Add that the Action parameter is the one with the overflow.  |      |    This patch description only identifies HttpSave.dll, not  |    RegGo.dll (as identified by CVE-2001-0678), but it implies  |    that multiple DLL's may have been fixed.
