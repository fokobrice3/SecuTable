A symbolic link has a name; in general, it appears like any other file in the file system. However, the link includes a reference to another file, often in another directory - perhaps in another sphere of control. Many common library functions that accept filenames will follow a symbolic link and use the link's target instead.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:The relationship between CWE-99 and CWE-610 needs further investigation and clarification. They might be duplicates. CWE-99 Resource Injection, as originally defined in Seven Pernicious Kingdoms taxonomy, emphasizes the identifier used to access a system resource such as a file name or port number, yet it explicitly states that the resource injection term does not apply to path manipulation, which effectively identifies the path at which a resource can be found and could be considered to be one aspect of a resource identifier. Also, CWE-610 effectively covers any type of resource, whether that resource is at the system layer, the application layer, or the code layer.::",
611,"Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference",Base,Draft,"The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.","XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing. By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as file:///c:/winnt/win.ini designates (in Windows) the file C:Winntwin.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning. Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:610:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:610:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:441:VIEW ID:1000::,"",::LANGUAGE NAME:XML:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Web Based:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","::TERM:XXE:DESCRIPTION:An acronym used for the term XML eXternal Entities::","::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:IMPACT:Read Files or Directories:NOTE:If the attacker is able to include a crafted DTD and a default entity resolver is enabled, the attacker may be able to access arbitrary files on the system.::SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:The DTD may include arbitrary HTTP requests that the server may execute.

In either case, the security gateway receiving the IPSec packet would not validate the integrity of the packet to ensure that it was not changed. Thus if the packets were intercepted the attacker could undetectably change some of the bits in the packets. The meaningful bit flipping was possible due to the known weaknesses in the CBC encryption mode. Since the attacker knew the structure of the packet, they were able (in one variation of the attack) to use bit flipping to change the destination IP of the packet to the destination machine controlled by the attacker. And so the destination security gateway would decrypt the packet and then forward the plaintext to the machine controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then read the original message. For instance if VPN was used with the vulnerable IPSec configuration the attacker could read the victim's e-mail. This vulnerability demonstrates the need to enforce the integrity service properly when critical data could be modified by an attacker. This problem might have also been mitigated by using an encryption mode that is not susceptible to bit flipping attacks, but the preferred mechanism to address this problem still remains message verification for integrity.
