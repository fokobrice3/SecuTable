CVE-2016-9459,MEDIUM,"Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed."
CVE-2016-9460,MEDIUM,Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a content-spoofing attack in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
CVE-2016-9461,MEDIUM,Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to modify existing files.
CVE-2016-9462,MEDIUM,Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying restore privileges when restoring a file. The restore capability of Nextcloud/ownCloud was not verifying whether a user has only read-only access to a share. Thus a user with read-only access was able to restore old versions.
CVE-2016-9463,MEDIUM,"Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability."
CVE-2016-9464,MEDIUM,"Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in the group."
CVE-2016-9465,LOW,Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Stored XSS in CardDAV image export. The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud/ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.
CVE-2016-9466,MEDIUM,"Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Reflected XSS in the Gallery application. The gallery app was not properly sanitizing exception messages from the Nextcloud/ownCloud server. Due to an endpoint where an attacker could influence the error message, this led to a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability."
CVE-2016-9467,MEDIUM,Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
CVE-2016-9468,MEDIUM,Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the dav app. The exception message displayed on the DAV endpoints contained partially user-controllable input leading to a potential misrepresentation of information.

CVE-2016-9470,HIGH,Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected File Download. `www/delivery/asyncspc.php` was vulnerable to the fairly new Reflected File Download (RFD) web attack vector that enables attackers to gain complete control over a victim's machine by virtually downloading a file from a trusted domain.
CVE-2016-9471,LOW,"Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver."
CVE-2016-9472,LOW,"Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected XSS. The Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost, dbUser, and possibly other parameters.

CVE-2016-9485,HIGH,"On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account. The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. The SecureConnector agent fails to set any permissions on downloaded file objects. This allows a malicious user to take ownership of any of these files and make modifications to it, regardless of where the files are saved. These files are then executed under SYSTEM privileges. A malicious unprivileged user can overwrite these executable files with malicious code before the SecureConnector agent executes them, causing the malicious code to be run under the SYSTEM account."

CVE-2016-9553,HIGH,The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.
CVE-2016-9554,HIGH,"The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account."
CVE-2016-9555,HIGH,"The sctp_sf_ootb function in net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.8 lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds slab access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP data."
CVE-2016-9556,MEDIUM,The IsPixelGray function in MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h in ImageMagick 7.0.3-8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap read) via a crafted image file.
