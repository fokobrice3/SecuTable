CVE-2017-1000254,Candidate,"libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","BID:101115   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115   |   CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch   |   CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/HT208331   |   DEBIAN:DSA-3992   |   URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992   |   GENTOO:GLSA-201712-04   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04   |   MLIST:[bookkeeper-issues] 20210628 [GitHub] [bookkeeper] padma81 opened a new issue #2746: Security Vulnerabilities in CentOS 7 image, Upgrade image to CentOS 8   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[bookkeeper-issues] 20210629 [GitHub] [bookkeeper] padma81 opened a new issue #2746: Security Vulnerabilities in CentOS 7 image, Upgrade image to CentOS 8   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:2486   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:3558   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558   |   SECTRACK:1039509   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509",Assigned (20171006),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2017-1000255,Candidate,"On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written.

CVE-2017-1000410,Candidate,"The Linux kernel version 3.3-rc1 and later is affected by a vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands - ConfigRequest, and ConfigResponse messages. This info leak is a result of uninitialized stack variables that may be returned to an attacker in their uninitialized state. By manipulating the code flows that precede the handling of these configuration messages, an attacker can also gain some control over which data will be held in the uninitialized stack variables. This can allow him to bypass KASLR, and stack canaries protection - as both pointers and stack canaries may be leaked in this manner. Combining this vulnerability (for example) with the previously disclosed RCE vulnerability in L2CAP configuration parsing (CVE-2017-1000251) may allow an attacker to exploit the RCE against kernels which were built with the above mitigations. These are the specifics of this vulnerability: In the function l2cap_parse_conf_rsp and in the function l2cap_parse_conf_req the following variable is declared without initialization: struct l2cap_conf_efs efs; In addition, when parsing input configuration parameters in both of these functions, the switch case for handling EFS elements may skip the memcpy call that will write to the efs variable: ... case L2CAP_CONF_EFS: if (olen == sizeof(efs)) memcpy(&efs, (void *)val, olen); ... The olen in the above if is attacker controlled, and regardless of that if, in both of these functions the efs variable would eventually be added to the outgoing configuration request that is being built: l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr, L2CAP_CONF_EFS, sizeof(efs), (unsigned long) &efs); So by sending a configuration request, or response, that contains an L2CAP_CONF_EFS element, but with an element length that is not sizeof(efs) - the memcpy to the uninitialized efs variable can be avoided, and the uninitialized variable would be returned to the attacker (16 bytes).","BID:102101   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102101   |   CONFIRM:https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4073   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4073   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4082   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4082   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20171206 Info Leak in the Linux Kernel via Bluetooth   |   URL:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q4/357   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:0654   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0654   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:0676   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0676   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:1062   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1062   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:1130   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1130   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:1170   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1170   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:1319   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1319   |   UBUNTU:USN-3933-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3933-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-3933-2   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3933-2/",Assigned (20171207),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
