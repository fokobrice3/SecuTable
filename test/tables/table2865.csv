CVE-2019-1002101,MEDIUM,"The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user’s machine.

An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the user’s machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user.
