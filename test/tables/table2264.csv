This makes it difficult  |    because if Maximizer has a concept of ""users"" and it is  |    designed to allow any user to modify any other user's data,  |    then this would not be a vulnerability or exposure, unless  |    that ""cross-user"" capability could be used to violate system  |    integrity, data confidentiality, or the like.  There are some  |    features of Maximizer 6.0 that, if abused, could allow someone  |    to do some bad things.  For example, an attacker could modify  |    the email addresses for contacts to redirect sales to  |    locations besides the customer.  There's also a capability of  |    assigning priorities and alarms, which could be susceptible to  |    an ""inconvenience attack"" at the very least, as well as  |    tie-ins to e-commerce capabilities.  |      |    The critical question becomes: ""how is this data shared"" in  |    the first place?  If it's through a network share or other  |    distribution method besides transferring the complete database  |    between sites, then this may be accessible to any attacker who  |    can mimic a Maximizer client (if there is such a thing as a  |    client), and this could be a vulnerability or exposure  |    according to the CVE definition.  |      |    However, since the Maximizer functionality is unknown to me  |    and not readily apparent from product documentation, it's hard  |    to know what to do about this one.  |    CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to MODIFY]  |    Frech> XF:maximizer-enterprise-calendar-modification(7590)"
