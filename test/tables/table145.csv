CWE-ID,Name,Weakness Abstraction,Status,Description
20,Improper Input Validation,Class,Stable,The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
22,Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),Base,Stable,The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
77,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'),Class,Draft,The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.
78,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'),Base,Stable,The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.
79,Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),Base,Stable,The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
89,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),Base,Stable,The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
119,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,Class,Stable,The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
125,Out-of-bounds Read,Base,Draft,The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
190,Integer Overflow or Wraparound,Base,Stable,The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.
200,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,Class,Draft,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
276,Incorrect Default Permissions,Base,Draft,During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.
287,Improper Authentication,Class,Draft,When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.
306,Missing Authentication for Critical Function,Base,Draft,The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.
352,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),Compound,Stable,The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.
416,Use After Free,Variant,Stable,Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.
434,Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type,Base,Draft,The product allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.
476,NULL Pointer Dereference,Base,Stable,A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.
502,Deserialization of Untrusted Data,Base,Draft,The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.
522,Insufficiently Protected Credentials,Class,Incomplete,The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.
611,Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference,Base,Draft,The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.
732,Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,Class,Draft,The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.
787,Out-of-bounds Write,Base,Draft,The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
798,Use of Hard-coded Credentials,Base,Draft,The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.
862,Missing Authorization,Class,Incomplete,The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
918,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),Base,Incomplete,The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.
