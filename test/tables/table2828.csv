Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains, it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a folder named "".git"" by using a vanity import path that ends with ""/.git"". If the Git repository root contains a ""HEAD"" file, a ""config"" file, an ""objects"" directory, a ""refs"" directory, with some work to ensure the proper ordering of operations, ""go get -u"" can be tricked into considering the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it. That will use the ""config"" file in the original Git repository root for its configuration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, they will execute on the system running ""go get -u""."

CVE-2018-1688,LOW,IBM Jazz Foundation (IBM Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management 5.0 through 6.0.6) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 145509.
CVE-2018-16880,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handle_rx() function in the [vhost_net] driver. A malicious virtual guest, under specific conditions, can trigger an out-of-bounds write in a kmalloc-8 slab on a virtual host which may lead to a kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. Versions from v4.16 and newer are vulnerable."
CVE-2018-16881,MEDIUM,"A denial of service vulnerability was found in rsyslog in the imptcp module. An attacker could send a specially crafted message to the imptcp socket, which would cause rsyslog to crash. Versions before 8.27.0 are vulnerable."
CVE-2018-16882,HIGH,"A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable."
CVE-2018-16883,LOW,"sssd versions from 1.13.0 to before 2.0.0 did not properly restrict access to the infopipe according to the ""allowed_uids"" configuration parameter. If sensitive information were stored in the user directory, this could be inadvertently disclosed to local attackers."
CVE-2018-16884,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares mounted in different network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out."
CVE-2018-16885,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy_fromiovecend() and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read beyond the buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and a system halt by accessing invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel version 3.10.x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7."
CVE-2018-16886,MEDIUM,"etcd versions 3.2.x before 3.2.26 and 3.3.x before 3.3.11 are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway."
CVE-2018-16887,LOW,A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the katello component of Satellite. An attacker with privilege to create/edit organizations and locations is able to execute a XSS attacks against other users through the Subscriptions or the Red Hat Repositories wizards. This can possibly lead to malicious code execution and extraction of the anti-CSRF token of higher privileged users. Versions before 3.9.0 are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-16888,LOW,"It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or privileged processes. Versions before v237 are vulnerable."
CVE-2018-16889,MEDIUM,Ceph does not properly sanitize encryption keys in debug logging for v4 auth. This results in the leaking of encryption key information in log files via plaintext. Versions up to v13.2.4 are vulnerable.
CVE-2018-16890,MEDIUM,"libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds."
