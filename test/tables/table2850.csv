This can be exploited via opportunistic locks and a high priority thread. The vulnerability is triggered when a scan starts. NOTE: any affected Heimdal products are completely unrelated to the Heimdal vendor of a Kerberos 5 product on the h5l.org web site."

Affects ISC DHCP versions 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, 4.4.0"
CVE-2018-5733,MEDIUM,"A malicious client which is allowed to send very large amounts of traffic (billions of packets) to a DHCP server can eventually overflow a 32-bit reference counter, potentially causing dhcpd to crash. Affects ISC DHCP 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, 4.4.0."
CVE-2018-5734,MEDIUM,"While handling a particular type of malformed packet BIND erroneously selects a SERVFAIL rcode instead of a FORMERR rcode. If the receiving view has the SERVFAIL cache feature enabled, this can trigger an assertion failure in badcache.c when the request doesn't contain all of the expected information. Affects BIND 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1, 9.10.6-S2."
CVE-2018-5735,MEDIUM,The Debian backport of the fix for CVE-2017-3137 leads to assertion failure in validator.c:1858; Affects Debian versions 9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u15; 9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u18; 9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u5; 9.11.5.P4+dfsg-5.1 No ISC releases are affected. Other packages from other distributions who did similar backports for the fix for 2017-3137 may also be affected.
CVE-2018-5736,LOW,"An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1."
CVE-2018-5737,MEDIUM,"A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1."
CVE-2018-5738,MEDIUM,"Change #4777 (introduced in October 2017) introduced an unforeseen issue in releases which were issued after that date, affecting which clients are permitted to make recursive queries to a BIND nameserver. The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the ""allow-recursion"" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if ""recursion no;"" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"" settings IF ""recursion yes;"" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of ""allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};"" if ""recursion yes;"" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when ""recursion yes;"" is in effect and no match list values are provided for ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"" for the setting of ""allow-recursion"" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the ""allow-query"" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition."
CVE-2018-5739,MEDIUM,"An extension to hooks capabilities which debuted in Kea 1.4.0 introduced a memory leak for operators who are using certain hooks library facilities. In order to support multiple requests simultaneously, Kea 1.4 added a callout handle store but unfortunately the initial implementation of this store does not properly free memory in every case. Hooks which make use of query4 or query6 parameters in their callouts can leak memory, resulting in the eventual exhaustion of available memory and subsequent failure of the server process. Affects Kea DHCP 1.4.0."
CVE-2018-5740,MEDIUM,"""deny-answer-aliases"" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.13, 9.10.0->9.10.8, 9.11.0->9.11.4, 9.12.0->9.12.2, 9.13.0->9.13.2."
CVE-2018-5741,MEDIUM,"To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3."
CVE-2018-5742,MEDIUM,"While backporting a feature for a newer branch of BIND9, RedHat introduced a path leading to an assertion failure in buffer.c:420. Affects RedHat versions bind-9.9.4-65.el7 -> bind-9.9.4-72.el7. No ISC releases are affected. Other packages from other distributions who made the same error may also be affected."
CVE-2018-5743,MEDIUM,"By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5.

Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected."
CVE-2018-5745,LOW,"""managed-keys"" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.
