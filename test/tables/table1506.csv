NOTE: it has been debated as to whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or Firefox. As of 20070711, it is CVE's opinion that IE appears to be failing to properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Firefox, and this issue could arise with other protocol handlers in IE as well. However, Mozilla has stated that it will address the issue with a ""defense in depth"" fix that will ""prevent IE from sending Firefox malicious data.""","BID:24837   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/24837   |   BUGTRAQ:20070710 Internet Explorer 0day exploit   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/473276/100/0/threaded   |   CERT:TA07-199A   |   URL:http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA07-199A.html   |   CERT-VN:VU#358017   |   URL:http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/358017   |   CONFIRM:ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-12.0/ChangeLog.txt   |   CONFIRM:http://support.novell.com/techcenter/psdb/07d098f99c9fe6956523beae37f32fda.html   |   CONFIRM:http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-23.html   |   CONFIRM:http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-40.html   |   FULLDISC:20070710 Internet Explorer 0day exploit   |   URL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2007-07/0160.html   |   HP:HPSBUX02153   |   URL:http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c00771742   |   HP:HPSBUX02156   |   URL:http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c00774579   |   HP:SSRT061181   |   URL:http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c00771742   |   HP:SSRT061236   |   URL:http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c00774579   |   IDEFENSE:20070719 Multiple Vendor Multiple Product URI Handler Input Validation Vulnerability   |   URL:http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=565   |   MANDRIVA:MDKSA-2007:152   |   URL:http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:152   |   MISC:http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2007/07/10/security-issue-in-url-protocol-handling-on-windows/   |   MISC:http://larholm.com/2007/07/10/internet-explorer-0day-exploit/   |   MISC:http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2007/07/10/blocking-the-firefox-gt-ie-0-day.aspx   |   MISC:http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/11/ie_firefox_vuln/   |   MISC:http://www.virusbtn.com/news/virus_news/2007/07_11.xml   |   MISC:http://www.xs-sniper.com/sniperscope/IE-Pwns-Firefox.html   |   OSVDB:38017   |   URL:http://osvdb.org/38017   |   SECTRACK:1018351   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1018351   |   SECTRACK:1018360   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1018360   |   SECUNIA:25984   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/25984   |   SECUNIA:26096   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26096   |   SECUNIA:26149   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26149   |   SECUNIA:26204   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26204   |   SECUNIA:26216   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26216   |   SECUNIA:26258   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26258   |   SECUNIA:26271   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26271   |   SECUNIA:26572   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/26572   |   SECUNIA:28179   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/28179   |   SECUNIA:28363   |   URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/28363   |   SUSE:SUSE-SA:2007:049   |   URL:http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2007_49_mozilla.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-503-1   |   URL:http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-503-1   |   VUPEN:ADV-2007-2473   |   URL:http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/2473   |   VUPEN:ADV-2007-2565   |   URL:http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/2565   |   VUPEN:ADV-2007-4272   |   URL:http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/4272   |   VUPEN:ADV-2008-0082   |   URL:http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/0082   |   XF:ie-firefoxurl-command-execution(35346)   |   URL:https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/35346",Assigned (20070710),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
