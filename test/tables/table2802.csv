CVE-2017-9792,MEDIUM,"In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with ""ALTER"" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it ""external"" and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an ""ALL"" privilege at the server scope.

CVE-2017-9852,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An Incorrect Password Management issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Default passwords exist that are rarely changed. User passwords will almost always be default. Installer passwords are expected to be default or similar across installations installed by the same company (but are sometimes changed). Hidden user accounts have (at least in some cases, though more research is required to test this for all hidden user accounts) a fixed password for all devices; it can never be changed by a user. Other vulnerabilities exist that allow an attacker to get the passwords of these hidden user accounts. NOTE: the vendor reports that it has no influence on the allocation of passwords, and that global hardcoded master passwords do not exist. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9853,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. All inverters have a very weak password policy for the user and installer password. No complexity requirements or length requirements are set. Also, strong passwords are impossible due to a maximum of 12 characters and a limited set of characters. NOTE: the vendor reports that the 12-character limit provides ""a very high security standard."" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9854,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sniffing for specific packets on the localhost, plaintext passwords can be obtained as they are typed into Sunny Explorer by the user. These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation likelihood is low because these packets are usually sent only once during installation. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9855,HIGH,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. A secondary authentication system is available for Installers called the Grid Guard system. This system uses predictable codes, and a single Grid Guard code can be used on any SMA inverter. Any such code, when combined with the installer account, allows changing very sensitive parameters. NOTE: the vendor reports that Grid Guard is not an authentication feature; it is only a tracing feature. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9856,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be decrypted very easily.

CVE-2017-9857,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SMAdata2+ communication protocol does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to man in the middle, packet injection, and replay attacks. Any setting change, authentication packet, scouting packet, etc. can be replayed, injected, or used for a man in the middle session. All functionalities available in Sunny Explorer can effectively be done from anywhere within the network as long as an attacker gets the packet setup correctly. This includes the authentication process for all (including hidden) access levels and the changing of settings in accordance with the gained access rights. Furthermore, because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9858,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sending crafted packets to an inverter and observing the response, active and inactive user accounts can be determined.

Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9859,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The inverters make use of a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests.

An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything: for example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE: the vendor reports that this attack has always been blocked by ""a final integrity and compatibility check.""

CVE-2017-9861,HIGH,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork.

CVE-2017-9862,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. When signed into Sunny Explorer with a wrong password, it is possible to create a debug report, disclosing information regarding the application and allowing the attacker to create and save a .txt file with contents to his liking. An attacker may use this for information disclosure, or to write a file to normally unavailable locations on the local system. NOTE: the vendor reports that ""the information contained in the debug report is of marginal significance."" Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected."
CVE-2017-9863,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. If a user simultaneously has Sunny Explorer running and visits a malicious host, cross-site request forgery can be used to change settings in the inverters (for example, issuing a POST request to change the user password). All Sunny Explorer settings available to the authenticated user are also available to the attacker. (In some cases, this also includes changing settings that the user has no access to.) This may result in complete compromise of the device. NOTE: the vendor reports that exploitation is unlikely because Sunny Explorer is used only rarely.
