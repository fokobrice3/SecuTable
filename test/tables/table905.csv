CVE-2021-26931,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as used in Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0001/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-7143aca8cb   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWQWPWYZRXVFJI5M3VCM72X27IB7CKOB/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8d45d297c6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2XQR52ICKRK3GC4HDWLMWF2U55YGAR63/   |   MISC:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-362.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210309 [SECURITY] [DLA 2586-1] linux security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210330 [SECURITY] [DLA 2610-1] linux-4.19 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00035.html",Assigned (20210209),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-26932,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and drivers/xen/gntdev.c.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0001/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-7143aca8cb   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWQWPWYZRXVFJI5M3VCM72X27IB7CKOB/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8d45d297c6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2XQR52ICKRK3GC4HDWLMWF2U55YGAR63/   |   MISC:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-361.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210309 [SECURITY] [DLA 2586-1] linux security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20210330 [SECURITY] [DLA 2610-1] linux-4.19 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00035.html",Assigned (20210209),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-26933,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is allowed to control whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. This means that Xen needs to ensure that all writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is happening before checking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.","DEBIAN:DSA-4888   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4888   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-47f53a940a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EOAJBVAVR6RSCUCHNXPVSNRPSFM7INMP/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-4c819bf1ad   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4GELN5E6MDR5KQBJF5M5COUUED3YFZTD/   |   MISC:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-364.html",Assigned (20210209),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
