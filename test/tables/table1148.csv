CVE-2022-23498,Candidate,"Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. When datasource query caching is enabled, Grafana caches all headers, including `grafana_session`. As a result, any user that queries a datasource where the caching is enabled can acquire another user&#8217;s session. To mitigate the vulnerability you can disable datasource query caching for all datasources. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.","MISC:https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-2j8f-6whh-frc8   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-2j8f-6whh-frc8",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2022-23499,Candidate,"HTML sanitizer is written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. In versions prior to 1.5.0 or 2.1.1, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML CDATA sections cannot be filtered and sanitized due to a parsing issue in the upstream package masterminds/html5. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of typo3/html-sanitizer. The upstream package masterminds/html5 provides HTML raw text elements (`script`, `style`, `noframes`, `noembed` and `iframe`) as DOMText nodes, which were not processed and sanitized further. None of the mentioned elements were defined in the default builder configuration, that's why only custom behaviors, using one of those tag names, were vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.5.0 and 2.1.1.","MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-hvwx-qh2h-xcfj   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-hvwx-qh2h-xcfj",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-23500,Candidate,"TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1, requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded. This vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is patched in versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20 or 12.1.1.","MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-8c28-5mp7-v24h   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-8c28-5mp7-v24h",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
