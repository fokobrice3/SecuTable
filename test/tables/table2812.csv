CVE-2018-11567,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill.

The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (""gibberish"") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range.

We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do. Customers do not need to take any action for these mitigations to work."""
