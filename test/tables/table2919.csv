CVE-2019-9675,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in PHP 7.x before 7.1.27 and 7.3.x before 7.3.3. phar_tar_writeheaders_int in ext/phar/tar.c has a buffer overflow via a long link value. NOTE: The vendor indicates that the link value is used only when an archive contains a symlink, which currently cannot happen: ""This issue allows theoretical compromise of security, but a practical attack is usually impossible."""
CVE-2019-9676,HIGH,"Buffer overflow vulnerability found in some Dahua IP Camera devices IPC-HFW1XXX,IPC-HDW1XXX,IPC-HFW2XXX Build before 2018/11. The vulnerability exits in the function of redirection display for serial port printing information, which can not be used by product basic functions. After an attacker logs in locally, this vulnerability can be exploited to cause device restart or arbitrary code execution. Dahua has identified the corresponding security problems in the static code auditing process, so it has gradually deleted this function, which is no longer available in the newer devices and softwares. Dahua has released versions of the affected products to fix the vulnerability."
CVE-2019-9677,HIGH,"The specific fields of CGI interface of some Dahua products are not strictly verified, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow by constructing malicious packets. Affected products include: IPC-HDW1X2X,IPC-HFW1X2X,IPC-HDW2X2X,IPC-HFW2X2X,IPC-HDW4X2X,IPC-HFW4X2X,IPC-HDBW4X2X,IPC-HDW5X2X,IPC-HFW5X2X for versions which Build time is before August 18, 2019."
CVE-2019-9678,MEDIUM,"Some Dahua products have the problem of denial of service during the login process. An attacker can cause a device crashed by constructing a malicious packet. Affected products include: IPC-HDW1X2X,IPC-HFW1X2X,IPC-HDW2X2X,IPC-HFW2X2X,IPC-HDW4X2X,IPC-HFW4X2X,IPC-HDBW4X2X,IPC-HDW5X2X,IPC-HFW5X2X for versions which Build time is before August 18, 2019."
CVE-2019-9679,MEDIUM,"Some of Dahua's Debug functions do not have permission separation. Low-privileged users can use the Debug function after logging in. Affected products include: IPC-HDW1X2X,IPC-HFW1X2X,IPC-HDW2X2X,IPC-HFW2X2X,IPC-HDW4X2X,IPC-HFW4X2X,IPC-HDBW4X2X,IPC-HDW5X2X,IPC-HFW5X2X for versions which Build time is before August 18,2019."
CVE-2019-9680,MEDIUM,"Some Dahua products have information leakage issues. Attackers can obtain the IP address and device model information of the device by constructing malicious data packets. Affected products include: IPC-HDW1X2X,IPC-HFW1X2X,IPC-HDW2X2X,IPC-HFW2X2X,IPC-HDW4X2X,IPC-HFW4X2X,IPC-HDBW4X2X,IPC-HDW5X2X,IPC-HFW5X2X for versions which Build time is before August 18, 2019."
CVE-2019-9681,MEDIUM,"Online upgrade information in some firmware packages of Dahua products is not encrypted. Attackers can obtain this information by analyzing firmware packages by specific means. Affected products include: IPC-HDW1X2X,IPC-HFW1X2X,IPC-HDW2X2X,IPC-HFW2X2X,IPC-HDW4X2X,IPC-HFW4X2X,IPC-HDBW4X2X,IPC-HDW5X2X,IPC-HFW5X2X for versions which Build time is before August 18,2019."
CVE-2019-9682,MEDIUM,"Dahua devices with Build time before December 2019 use strong security login mode by default, but in order to be compatible with the normal login of early devices, some devices retain the weak security login mode that users can control. If the user uses a weak security login method, an attacker can monitor the device network to intercept network packets to attack the device. So it is recommended that the user disable this login method."
CVE-2019-9686,HIGH,"pacman before 5.1.3 allows directory traversal when installing a remote package via a specified URL ""pacman -U <url>"" due to an unsanitized file name received from a Content-Disposition header. pacman renames the downloaded package file to match the name given in this header. However, pacman did not sanitize this name, which may contain slashes, before calling rename(). A malicious server (or a network MitM if downloading over HTTP) can send a Content-Disposition header to make pacman place the file anywhere in the filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary root code execution. Notably, this bypasses pacman's package signature checking. This occurs in curl_download_internal in lib/libalpm/dload.c."
CVE-2019-9687,HIGH,PoDoFo 0.9.6 has a heap-based buffer overflow in PdfString::ConvertUTF16toUTF8 in base/PdfString.cpp.
