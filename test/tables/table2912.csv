CVE-2019-7298,HIGH,"An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware through 1.02B03. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body, such as a body of ' /bin/telnetd' for the GetDeviceSettingsset API function. Consequently, an attacker can execute any command remotely when they control this input."
CVE-2019-7299,MEDIUM,A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the submit_ticket.php module in the WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System plugin 9.1.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the subject parameter in wp-content/plugins/wp-support-plus-responsive-ticket-system/includes/ajax/submit_ticket.php.
CVE-2019-7300,HIGH,"Artica Proxy 3.06.200056 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root by reading the ressources/settings.inc ldap_admin and ldap_password fields, using these credentials at logon.php, and then entering the commands in the admin.index.php command-line field."
CVE-2019-7301,HIGH,Zen Load Balancer 3.10.1 allows remote authenticated admin users to execute arbitrary commands as root via shell metacharacters in the index.cgi?action=View_Cert certname parameter.
CVE-2019-7303,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the seccomp filters of Canonical snapd before version 2.37.4 allows a strict mode snap to insert characters into a terminal on a 64-bit host. The seccomp rules were generated to match 64-bit ioctl(2) commands on a 64-bit platform; however, the Linux kernel only uses the lower 32 bits to determine which ioctl(2) commands to run. This issue affects: Canonical snapd versions prior to 2.37.4."
CVE-2019-7304,HIGH,"Canonical snapd before version 2.37.1 incorrectly performed socket owner validation, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands as root. This issue affects: Canonical snapd versions prior to 2.37.1."
CVE-2019-7305,HIGH,"Information Exposure vulnerability in eXtplorer makes the /usr/ and /etc/extplorer/ system directories world-accessible over HTTP. Introduced in the Makefile patch file debian/patches/debian-changes-2.1.0b6+dfsg-1 or debian/patches/adds-a-makefile.patch, this can lead to data leakage, information disclosure and potentially remote code execution on the web server. This issue affects all versions of eXtplorer in Ubuntu and Debian"
CVE-2019-7306,MEDIUM,"Byobu Apport hook may disclose sensitive information since it automatically uploads the local user's .screenrc which may contain private hostnames, usernames and passwords. This issue affects: byobu"
CVE-2019-7307,MEDIUM,"Apport before versions 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm1, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.19, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.7, 2.20.10-0ubuntu27.1, 2.20.11-0ubuntu5 contained a TOCTTOU vulnerability when reading the users ~/.apport-ignore.xml file, which allows a local attacker to replace this file with a symlink to any other file on the system and so cause Apport to include the contents of this other file in the resulting crash report. The crash report could then be read by that user either by causing it to be uploaded and reported to Launchpad, or by leveraging some other vulnerability to read the resulting crash report, and so allow the user to read arbitrary files on the system."
CVE-2019-7308,MEDIUM,"kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.20.6 performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks."
CVE-2019-7309,LOW,"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, the memcmp function for the x32 architecture can incorrectly return zero (indicating that the inputs are equal) because the RDX most significant bit is mishandled."
CVE-2019-7310,MEDIUM,"In Poppler 0.73.0, a heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, as demonstrated by pdftocairo."
CVE-2019-7311,HIGH,"An issue was discovered on Linksys WRT1900ACS 1.0.3.187766 devices. A lack of encryption in how the user login cookie (admin-auth) is stored on a victim's computer results in the admin password being discoverable by a local attacker, and usable to gain administrative access to the victim's router. The admin password is stored in base64 cleartext in an ""admin-auth"" cookie. An attacker sniffing the network at the time of login could acquire the router's admin password. Alternatively, gaining physical access to the victim's computer soon after an administrative login could result in compromise."
