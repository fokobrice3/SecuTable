CVE-2000-0572,Razor,2007-02-22,Al Menendez,"Subsequent releases of Razor address this issue and utilize a more robust encryption mechanism for the Razor password. If you are under maintenance, you have the option of upgrading to a more recent release of Razor at no cost.  If you are not under maintenance and want to upgrade then you will need to contact Jennifer Stone at jstone@visible.com.

Some additional notes ...

- With version 4.1 and above, administrators of Razor may switch and use the local OS authentication instead of Razorâ€™s authentication method.

- OS permissions and protections always apply to the artifacts stored in the database.

- This notice applies to users that have already logged into the supporting system.  This primary means of defense is intact inspite of this particular vulnerability.

- The next Razor release (due out in mid-2007) will allow remote UNIX clients to utilize SSH to authenticate the remote user.  More information on this release and others may be found on the Visible Systems web site:

Please contact Visible Systems Corporation at 1-800-6-VISIBLE if you have additional questions."
