CVE-2007-1890,Red Hat,2007-04-16,Mark J Cox,"The PHP interpreter does not offer a reliable &quot;sandboxed&quot; security
layer (as found in, say, a JVM) in which untrusted scripts can be run;
any script run by the PHP interpreter must be trusted with the
privileges of the interpreter itself.  We therefore do not classify
this issue as security-sensitive since no trust boundary is crossed."
