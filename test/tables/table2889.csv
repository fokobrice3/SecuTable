CVE-2019-1719,LOW,"A vulnerability in the web-based guest portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco ISE software version 2.1 is affected."
CVE-2019-17190,HIGH,"A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Avast Secure Browser 76.0.1659.101. The vulnerability is due to an insecure ACL set by the AvastBrowserUpdate.exe (which is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) when AvastSecureBrowser.exe checks for new updates. When the update check is triggered, the elevated process cleans the ACL of the Update.ini file in %PROGRAMDATA%\Avast Software\Browser\Update\ and sets all privileges to group Everyone. Because any low-privileged user can create, delete, or modify the Update.ini file stored in this location, an attacker with low privileges can create a hard link named Update.ini in this folder, and make it point to a file writable by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Once AvastBrowserUpdate.exe is triggered by the update check functionality, the DACL is set to a misconfigured value on the crafted Update.ini and, consequently, to the target file that was previously not writable by the low-privileged attacker."
CVE-2019-17191,MEDIUM,"The Signal Private Messenger application before 4.47.7 for Android allows a caller to force a call to be answered, without callee user interaction, via a connect message.

CVE-2019-1720,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the XML API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU to increase to 100% utilization, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted XML payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition until the system is manually rebooted. Software versions prior to X12.5.1 are affected."
CVE-2019-17201,HIGH,"FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. When a user requests elevation using the AdminByRequest.exe interface, the interface communicates with the underlying service (Audckq32.exe) using a .NET named pipe. If the underlying service responds that a user is permitted access to the elevation feature, the client then reinitiates communication with the underlying service and requests elevation. This elevation request has no local checks in the service, and depends on client-side validation in the AdminByRequest.exe interface, i.e., it is a vulnerable exposed functionality in the service. By communicating directly with the underlying service, any user can request elevation and obtain Administrator privilege regardless of group policies or permissions."
CVE-2019-17202,HIGH,"FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. If a user does not have direct access to the elevation feature through group policies, they are prompted to enter a PIN code in a challenge-response manner upon attempting to elevate privileges. The challenge's response uses a simple algorithm that can be easily emulated via data (customer ID and device name) available to all users, and thus any user can elevate to Administrator privilege."
CVE-2019-17203,LOW,TeamPass 2.1.27.36 allows Stored XSS at the Search page by setting a crafted password for an item in any folder.
CVE-2019-17204,LOW,TeamPass 2.1.27.36 allows Stored XSS by setting a crafted Knowledge Base label and adding any available item.

CVE-2019-1721,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the phone book feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU to increase to 100% utilization, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message with a crafted XML payload to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention may be required to recover the device. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Releases X12.5.1 and later."
CVE-2019-17210,MEDIUM,"A denial-of-service issue was discovered in the MQTT library in Arm Mbed OS 2017-11-02. The function readMQTTLenString() is called by the function MQTTDeserialize_publish() to get the length and content of the MQTT topic name. In the function readMQTTLenString(), mqttstring->lenstring.len is a part of user input, which can be manipulated. An attacker can simply change it to a larger value to invalidate the if statement so that the statements inside the if statement are skipped, letting the value of mqttstring->lenstring.data default to zero. Later, curn is accessed, which points to mqttstring->lenstring.data. On an Arm Cortex-M chip, the value at address 0x0 is actually the initialization value for the MSP register. It is highly dependent on the actual firmware. Therefore, the behavior of the program is unpredictable from this time on."
CVE-2019-17211,HIGH,"An integer overflow was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.14.0. The function sn_coap_builder_calc_needed_packet_data_size_2() is used to calculate the required memory for the CoAP message from the sn_coap_hdr_s data structure. Both returned_byte_count and src_coap_msg_ptr->payload_len are of type uint16_t. When added together, the result returned_byte_count can wrap around the maximum uint16_t value. As a result, insufficient buffer space is allocated for the corresponding CoAP message."
CVE-2019-17212,HIGH,"Buffer overflows were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.14.0. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop, the current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer, as well as by the 0xFF delimiter byte. Inside each while loop, the check of the value of *packet_data_pptr is not strictly enforced. More specifically, inside a loop, *packet_data_pptr could be increased and then dereferenced without checking. Moreover, there are many other functions in the format of sn_coap_parser_****() that do not check whether the pointer is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based buffer overflows, depending on how the CoAP packet buffer is allocated."
CVE-2019-17213,MEDIUM,The WebARX plugin 1.3.0 for WordPress has unauthenticated stored XSS via the URI or the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.
CVE-2019-17214,MEDIUM,The WebARX plugin 1.3.0 for WordPress allows firewall bypass by appending &cc=1 to a URI.

CVE-2019-1722,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the FindMe feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software version X12.5.1 and later."

CVE-2019-17507,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-816 A1 1.06 devices. An attacker could access management pages of the router via a client that ignores the 'top.location.href = ""/dir_login.asp""' line in a .asp file. This provides access to d_status.asp, version.asp, d_dhcptbl.asp, and d_acl.asp."
CVE-2019-17508,HIGH,"On D-Link DIR-859 A3-1.06 and DIR-850 A1.13 devices, /etc/services/DEVICE.TIME.php allows command injection via the $SERVER variable."
CVE-2019-17509,HIGH,D-Link DIR-846 devices with firmware 100A35 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands as root by leveraging admin access and sending a /HNAP1/ request for SetMasterWLanSettings with shell metacharacters to /squashfs-root/www/HNAP1/control/SetMasterWLanSettings.php.
CVE-2019-1751,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) functions of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause either an interface queue wedge or a device reload. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain IPv4 packet streams that are sent through the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packet streams through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to either cause an interface queue wedge or a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
CVE-2019-17510,HIGH,D-Link DIR-846 devices with firmware 100A35 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands as root by leveraging admin access and sending a /HNAP1/ request for SetWizardConfig with shell metacharacters to /squashfs-root/www/HNAP1/control/SetWizardConfig.php.
CVE-2019-17511,MEDIUM,"There are some web interfaces without authentication requirements on D-Link DIR-412 A1-1.14WW routers. An attacker can get the router's log file via log_get.php, which could be used to discover the intranet network structure."
CVE-2019-17512,MEDIUM,"There are some web interfaces without authentication requirements on D-Link DIR-412 A1-1.14WW routers. An attacker can clear the router's log file via act=clear&logtype=sysact to log_clear.php, which could be used to erase attack traces."
CVE-2019-17513,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Ratpack before 1.7.5. Due to a misuse of the Netty library class DefaultHttpHeaders, there is no validation that headers lack HTTP control characters. Thus, if untrusted data is used to construct HTTP headers with Ratpack, HTTP Response Splitting can occur."
CVE-2019-17514,MEDIUM,"library/glob.html in the Python 2 and 3 documentation before 2016 has potentially misleading information about whether sorting occurs, as demonstrated by irreproducible cancer-research results. NOTE: the effects of this documentation cross application domains, and thus it is likely that security-relevant code elsewhere is affected. This issue is not a Python implementation bug, and there are no reports that NMR researchers were specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words, because the older documentation stated ""finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell,"" one might have incorrectly inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also occurred for glob.glob. There is a workaround in newer versions of Willoughby nmr-data_compilation-p2.py and nmr-data_compilation-p3.py, which call sort() directly."
CVE-2019-17515,MEDIUM,"The CleanTalk cleantalk-spam-protect plugin before 5.127.4 for WordPress is affected by: Cross Site Scripting (XSS). The impact is: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code via the from or till parameter. The component is: inc/cleantalk-users.php and inc/cleantalk-comments.php. The attack vector is: When the Administrator is logged in, a reflected XSS may execute upon a click on a malicious URL."
CVE-2019-17517,MEDIUM,"The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation on Dialog Semiconductor SDK through 5.0.4 for DA14580/1/2/3 devices does not properly restrict the L2CAP payload length, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a buffer overflow via a crafted Link Layer packet."
CVE-2019-17518,MEDIUM,"The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation on Dialog Semiconductor SDK through 1.0.14.1081 for DA1468x devices responds to link layer packets with a payload length larger than expected, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a buffer overflow via a crafted packet. This affects, for example, August Smart Lock."
CVE-2019-17519,MEDIUM,"The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation on NXP SDK through 2.2.1 for KW41Z devices does not properly restrict the Link Layer payload length, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a buffer overflow via a crafted packet."
CVE-2019-1752,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the ISDN functions of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of specific values in the Q.931 information elements. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by calling the affected device with specific Q.931 information elements being present. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device."
CVE-2019-17520,MEDIUM,"The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation on Texas Instruments SDK through 3.30.00.20 for CC2640R2 devices does not properly restrict the SM Public Key packet on reception, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted packets."
