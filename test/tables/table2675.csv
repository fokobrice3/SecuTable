CVE-2014-9422,MEDIUM,"The check_rpcsec_auth function in kadmin/server/kadm_rpc_svc.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass a kadmin/* authorization check and obtain administrative access by leveraging access to a two-component principal with an initial ""kadmind"" substring, as demonstrated by a ""ka/x"" principal."
CVE-2014-9423,MEDIUM,"The svcauth_gss_accept_sec_context function in lib/rpc/svc_auth_gss.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.11.x through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x before 1.13.1 transmits uninitialized interposer data to clients, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process heap memory by sniffing the network for data in a handle field."
CVE-2014-9424,HIGH,Double free vulnerability in the ssl_parse_clienthello_use_srtp_ext function in d1_srtp.c in LibreSSL before 2.1.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a certain length-verification error during processing of a DTLS handshake.
CVE-2014-9425,HIGH,Double free vulnerability in the zend_ts_hash_graceful_destroy function in zend_ts_hash.c in the Zend Engine in PHP through 5.5.20 and 5.6.x through 5.6.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2014-9426,HIGH,"** DISPUTED ** The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable."
CVE-2014-9427,HIGH,"sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used to read a .php file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might (1) allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2) trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping."
CVE-2014-9428,HIGH,"The batadv_frag_merge_packets function in net/batman-adv/fragmentation.c in the B.A.T.M.A.N. implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 uses an incorrect length field during a calculation of an amount of memory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented packets."
CVE-2014-9429,MEDIUM,Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Smoothwall Express 3.1 and 3.0 SP3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) PROFILENAME parameter in a Save action to httpd/cgi-bin/pppsetup.cgi or (2) COMMENT parameter in an Add action to httpd/cgi-bin/ddns.cgi.
CVE-2014-9430,MEDIUM,Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in httpd/cgi-bin/vpn.cgi/vpnconfig.dat in Smoothwall Express 3.0 SP3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the COMMENT parameter in an Add action.
CVE-2014-9431,MEDIUM,Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Smoothwall Express 3.1 and 3.0 SP3 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that change the (1) admin or (2) dial password via a request to httpd/cgi-bin/changepw.cgi.
CVE-2014-9432,MEDIUM,Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in templates/2k11/admin/overview.inc.tpl in Serendipity before 2.0-rc2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a blog comment in the QUERY_STRING to serendipity/index.php.
CVE-2014-9433,LOW,"Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in cms/front_content.php in Contenido before 4.9.6, when advanced mod rewrite (AMR) is disabled, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) idart, (2) lang, or (3) idcat parameter."
CVE-2014-9434,LOW,Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in admin/managerrelated.php in the administrative backend in Absolut Engine 1.73 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the title parameter.
