The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device.

1220,"Insufficient Granularity of Access Control",Base,Incomplete,"The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.","Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection. A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely.

1221,"Incorrect Register Defaults or Module Parameters",Base,Incomplete,"Hardware description language code incorrectly defines register defaults or hardware IP parameters to insecure values.","Integrated circuits and hardware IP software programmable controls and settings are commonly stored in register circuits. These register contents have to be initialized at hardware reset to defined default values that are hard coded in the hardware description language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. Hardware descriptive languages also support definition of parameter variables, which can be defined in code during instantiation of the hardware IP module. Such parameters are generally used to configure a specific instance of a hardware IP in the design. The system security settings of a hardware design can be affected by incorrectly defined default values or IP parameters. The hardware IP would be in an insecure state at power reset, and this can be exposed or exploited by untrusted software running on the system. Both register defaults and parameters are hardcoded values, which cannot be changed using software or firmware patches but must be changed in hardware silicon. Thus, such security issues are considerably more difficult to address later in the lifecycle. Hardware designs can have a large number of such parameters and register defaults settings, and it is important to have design tool support to check these settings in an automated way and be able to identify which settings are security sensitive.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:665:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE NAME:Verilog:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:VHDL:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during implementation of hardware design, since IP parameters and defaults are defined in HDL code and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Varies by Context:NOTE:Degradation of system functionality, or loss of access control enforcement can occur.::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:During hardware design, all the system parameters and register defaults must be reviewed to identify security sensitive settings.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:The default values of these security sensitive settings need to be defined as part of the design review phase.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Testing phase should use automated tools to test that values are configured per design specifications.::","",,,"",::166::,"",
