CVE-2018-20735,Candidate,"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in BMC PATROL Agent through 11.3.01. It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation by means of a custom, non-default configuration.","EXPLOIT-DB:46556   |   URL:https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46556/   |   MISC:https://www.securifera.com/blog/2018/12/17/bmc-patrol-agent-domain-user-to-domain-admin/",Assigned (20190117),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
