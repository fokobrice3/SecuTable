Specifically, an unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request to the REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin's MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension) and finally a trailing .phtml file extension.","MISC:https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-live-chat-support/#developers   |   MISC:https://wp-livechat.com/   |   MISC:https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9320",Assigned (20190411),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
