A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute a set of normally unauthorized commands with the privileges of a non-root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.","CISCO:20200819 Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences Restricted Shell Escape Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cmx-rshell-esc-L6hBwjbg",Assigned (20191212),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
