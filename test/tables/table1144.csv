A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build pipeline.

CVE-2022-23005,Candidate,"Western Digital has identified a weakness in the UFS standard that could result in a security vulnerability. This vulnerability may exist in some systems where the Host boot ROM code implements the UFS Boot feature to boot from UFS compliant storage devices. The UFS Boot feature, as specified in the UFS standard, is provided by UFS devices to support platforms that need to download the system boot loader from external non-volatile storage locations. Several scenarios have been identified in which adversaries may disable the boot capability, or revert to an old boot loader code, if the host boot ROM code is improperly implemented. UFS Host Boot ROM implementers may be impacted by this vulnerability. UFS devices are only impacted when connected to a vulnerable UFS Host and are not independently impacted by this vulnerability. When present, the vulnerability is in the UFS Host implementation and is not a vulnerability in Western Digital UFS Devices. Western Digital has provided details of the vulnerability to the JEDEC standards body, multiple vendors of host processors, and software solutions providers.","MISC:https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/collateral/white-paper/white-paper-host-boot-rom-code-vulnerability-and-mitigation.pdf   |   URL:https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/collateral/white-paper/white-paper-host-boot-rom-code-vulnerability-and-mitigation.pdf   |   MISC:https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-23001-host-boot-rom-code-vulnerability-in-systems-implementing-ufs-boot-feature   |   URL:https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-23001-host-boot-rom-code-vulnerability-in-systems-implementing-ufs-boot-feature",Assigned (20220110),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.","DEBIAN:DSA-5117   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-0cc3916e08   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OMR6UBGJW6JKND7IILGQ2CU35EQPF3E3/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202208-23   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23   |   MISC:https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-395.txt   |   URL:https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-395.txt   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20220125 Xen Security Advisory 395 v2 (CVE-2022-23035) - Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/4",Assigned (20220110),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
