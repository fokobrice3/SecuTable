CVE-1999-0001,Candidate,"ip_input.c in BSD-derived TCP/IP implementations allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) via crafted packets.","BUGTRAQ:19981223 Re: CERT Advisory CA-98.13 - TCP/IP Denial of Service   |   CERT:CA-98-13-tcp-denial-of-service   |   CONFIRM:http://www.openbsd.org/errata23.html#tcpfix   |   OSVDB:5707   |   URL:http://www.osvdb.org/5707",Modified (20051217),"   MODIFY(1) Frech  |     NOOP(2) Northcutt, Wall  |     REVIEWING(1) Christey","Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with  |    ""short packets with certain options set,"" so the description  |    should be modified accordingly.  |      |    But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related  |    to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in  |    BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release  |    The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.  |    The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.
