An authenticated attacker would be able to obtain the file /var/tmp/admin.passwd after executing a Backup operation. This file can be manually modified to change the GUID of the user to 0 (root) and change the restricted shell to a normal shell /bin/sh. After the modification is done, the file can be recompressed to a .tar.bz file and imported again via the Import Backup functionality. The properties of the admin user will be overwritten and a root shell will be granted to the user upon the next successful login.","MISC:https://github.com/felmoltor   |   MISC:https://sensepost.com/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/   |   MISC:https://twitter.com/felmoltor   |   MISC:https://www.titanhq.com",Assigned (20200813),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
