CVE-2013-3926,Atlassian,2013-07-09,,"On 30th of June 2013, an article was uploaded to Slashdot regarding
two vulnerabilities in Atlassian Crowd. We had already identified and
fixed the first vulnerability, which affects only standalone Crowd
servers and which the author had labeled CVE-2013-3925. Patches and
updated packages are available at
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-3366.

We have been unable to substantiate the existence of the second
alleged vulnerability. The author of the article has not contacted
Atlassian and has provided no details to us, making it difficult to
validate the claim.
