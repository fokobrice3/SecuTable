CVE-2022-31006,Candidate,"indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-x996-7qh9-7ff7   |   URL:https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-x996-7qh9-7ff7   |   MISC:https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/53a2a1bf1a26cb8ba710fd6adc8bcf275186a4b3   |   URL:https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/53a2a1bf1a26cb8ba710fd6adc8bcf275186a4b3",Assigned (20220518),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

This can occur when using either the `Form#bindFromRequest` method on a JSON request body or the `Form#bind` method directly on a JSON value. If the JSON data being bound to the form contains a deeply-nested JSON object or array, the form binding implementation may consume all available heap space and cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. If executing on the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error` is enabled&#8212;as it is by default&#8212;then this can crash the application process. `Form.bindFromRequest` is vulnerable when using any body parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or `JsValue` in Scala, or one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes Play's default body parser. This vulnerability been patched in version 2.8.16. There is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that can be parsed, which can be configured by the user if necessary. As a workaround, applications that do not need to parse a request body of type `application/json` can switch from the default body parser to another body parser that supports only the specific type of body they expect.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-v8x6-59g4-5g3w   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-v8x6-59g4-5g3w   |   MISC:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11301   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11301   |   MISC:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16",Assigned (20220518),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-31022,Candidate,"Bleve is a text indexing library for go. Bleve includes HTTP utilities under bleve/http package, that are used by its sample application. These HTTP methods pave way for exploitation of a node&#8217;s filesystem where the bleve index resides, if the user has used bleve&#8217;s own HTTP (bleve/http) handlers for exposing the access to the indexes. For instance, the CreateIndexHandler (`http/index_create.go`) and DeleteIndexHandler (`http/index_delete.go`) enable an attacker to create a bleve index (directory structure) anywhere where the user running the server has the write permissions and to delete recursively any directory owned by the same user account. Users who have used the bleve/http package for exposing access to bleve index without the explicit handling for the Role Based Access Controls(RBAC) of the index assets would be impacted by this issue. There is no patch for this issue because the http package is purely intended to be used for demonstration purposes. Bleve was never designed handle the RBACs, nor it was ever advertised to be used in that way. The collaborators of this project have decided to stay away from adding any authentication or authorization to bleve project at the moment. The bleve/http package is mainly for demonstration purposes and it lacks exhaustive validation of the user inputs as well as any authentication and authorization measures.

CVE-2022-31023,Candidate,"Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. Verions prior to 2.8.16 are vulnerable to generation of error messages containing sensitive information. Play Framework, when run in dev mode, shows verbose errors for easy debugging, including an exception stack trace. Play does this by configuring its `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` to do so based on the application mode. In its Scala API Play also provides a static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` that is configured to always show verbose errors. This is used as a default value in some Play APIs, so it is possible to inadvertently use this version in production. It is also possible to improperly configure the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error handler. Both of these situations could result in verbose errors displaying to users in a production application, which could expose sensitive information from the application. In particular, the constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for `CORSActionBuilder` use the static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` as a default value. This is patched in Play Framework 2.8.16. The `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object has been changed to use the prod-mode behavior, and `DevHttpErrorHandler` has been introduced for the dev-mode behavior. A workaround is available. When constructing a `CORSFilter` or `CORSActionBuilder`, ensure that a properly-configured error handler is passed. Generally this should be done by using the `HttpErrorHandler` instance provided through dependency injection or through Play's `BuiltInComponents`. Ensure that the application is not using the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` static object in any code that may be run in production.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-p9p4-97g9-wcrh   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-p9p4-97g9-wcrh   |   MISC:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11305   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11305   |   MISC:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16   |   URL:https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16",Assigned (20220518),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-31104,Candidate,"Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. In affected versions wasmtime's implementation of the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly on x86_64 contained two distinct bugs in the instruction lowerings implemented in Cranelift. The aarch64 implementation of the simd proposal is not affected. The bugs were presented in the `i8x16.swizzle` and `select` WebAssembly instructions. The `select` instruction is only affected when the inputs are of `v128` type. The correspondingly affected Cranelift instructions were `swizzle` and `select`. The `swizzle` instruction lowering in Cranelift erroneously overwrote the mask input register which could corrupt a constant value, for example. This means that future uses of the same constant may see a different value than the constant itself. The `select` instruction lowering in Cranelift wasn't correctly implemented for vector types that are 128-bits wide. When the condition was 0 the wrong instruction was used to move the correct input to the output of the instruction meaning that only the low 32 bits were moved and the upper 96 bits of the result were left as whatever the register previously contained (instead of the input being moved from). The `select` instruction worked correctly if the condition was nonzero, however. This bug in Wasmtime's implementation of these instructions on x86_64 represents an incorrect implementation of the specified semantics of these instructions according to the WebAssembly specification. The impact of this is benign for hosts running WebAssembly but represents possible vulnerabilities within the execution of a guest program. For example a WebAssembly program could take unintended branches or materialize incorrect values internally which runs the risk of exposing the program itself to other related vulnerabilities which can occur from miscompilations. We have released Wasmtime 0.38.1 and cranelift-codegen (and other associated cranelift crates) 0.85.1 which contain the corrected implementations of these two instructions in Cranelift. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by disabling the Wasm simd proposal. Additionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts. Other aarch64 hosts are not affected. Note that s390x hosts don't yet implement the simd proposal and are not affected.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-jqwc-c49r-4w2x   |   URL:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-jqwc-c49r-4w2x   |   MISC:https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd   |   URL:https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd   |   MISC:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4317   |   URL:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4317   |   MISC:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4318   |   URL:https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4318   |   MISC:https://github.com/webassembly/simd   |   URL:https://github.com/webassembly/simd   |   MISC:https://webassembly.github.io/spec/   |   URL:https://webassembly.github.io/spec/",Assigned (20220518),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
