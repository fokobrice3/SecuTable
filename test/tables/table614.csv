CVE-2020-1679,Candidate,"On Juniper Networks PTX and QFX Series devices with packet sampling configured using tunnel-observation mpls-over-udp, sampling of a malformed packet can cause the Kernel Routing Table (KRT) queue to become stuck. KRT is the module within the Routing Process Daemon (RPD) that synchronized the routing tables with the forwarding tables in the kernel. This table is then synchronized to the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) via the KRT queue. Thus, when KRT queue become stuck, it can lead to unexpected packet forwarding issues. An administrator can monitor the following command to check if there is the KRT queue is stuck: user@device > show krt state ...

CVE-2020-1681,Candidate,"Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability.
