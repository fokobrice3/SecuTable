CVE-2020-8562,Candidate,"As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access private networks on the control plane.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220225-0002/   |   MISC:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101493   |   URL:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101493   |   MISC:https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/-MFX60_wdOY   |   URL:https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/-MFX60_wdOY",Assigned (20200203),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
