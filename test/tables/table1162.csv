CVE-2022-24735,Candidate,"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-647m-2wmq-qmvq   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-647m-2wmq-qmvq   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220715-0003/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220715-0003/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-44373f6778   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J4ZK3675DGHVVDOFLJN7WX6YYH27GPMK/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-6ed1ce2838   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VPYKSG7LKUJGVM2P72EHXKVRVRWHLORX/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-a0a4c7eb31   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WSTPUCAPBRHIFPSCOURR4OYX4E2OISAF/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202209-17   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-17   |   MISC:https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10651   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/10651   |   MISC:https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.7   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.7   |   MISC:https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.0   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.0   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html",Assigned (20220210),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-24765,Candidate,"Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.","CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213261   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-2a5de7cb8b   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDI325LOO2XBDDKLINOAQJEG6MHAURZE/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-2fec5f30be   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SLP42KIZ6HACTVZMZLJLFJQ4W2XYT27M/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-3759ebabd2   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BENQYTDGUL6TF3UALY6GSIEXIHUIYNWM/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-dfd7e7fc0e   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRZG5CDUQ27OWTPC5MQOR4UASNXHWEZS/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-e99ae504f5   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PTN5NYEHYN2OQSHSAMCNICZNK2U4QH6/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-1068309389   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVOLER2PIGMHPQMDGG4RDE2KZB74QLA2/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-3ec32f6d4e   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UDZRZAL7QULOB6V7MKT66MOMWJLBJPX4/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-470c7ea49e   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIKWISWUDFT2FAITYIA6372BVLH3OOOC/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2023-e3c8abd37e   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YROCMBWYFKRSS64PO6FUNM6L7LKBUKVW/   |   FULLDISC:20220516 APPLE-SA-2022-05-16-8 Xcode 13.4   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/May/31   |   MISC:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash   |   URL:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash   |   MISC:https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode   |   URL:https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20221213 [SECURITY] [DLA 3239-1] git security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20220412 git v2.35.2 and friends for CVE-2022-24765   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7",Assigned (20220210),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-24767,Candidate,"Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. Since part of Git for Windows' uninstaller is copied into the current user's temporary directory and run in that place, it is important to ensure that there are no malicious `.dll` file in that directory that might be loaded as part of loading the executable. However, the default system settings for `TMP` and `TEMP` are to point to `C:\Windows\Temp`, a folder that is world-writable (for historical reasons), and the SYSTEM user account inherits those settings.

CVE-2022-24769,Candidate,"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5162   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5162   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-3826c8f549   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HQCVS7WBFSTKJFNX5PGDRARMTOFWV2O7/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-c07546070d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5FQJ3MLFSEKQYCFPFZIKYGBXPZUJFVY/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-cac2323802   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5AFKOQ5CE3CEIULWW4FLQKHFFU6FSYG/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-e9a09c1a7d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FPOJUJZXGMIVKRS4QR75F6OIXNQ6LDBL/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-ed53f2439a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6PMQKCAPK2AR3DCYITJYMMNBEGQBGLCC/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-eda0049dd7   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HIMAHZ6AUIKN7AX26KHZYBXVECIOVWBH/   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/2bbc786e4c59761d722d2d1518cd0a32829bc07f   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/2bbc786e4c59761d722d2d1518cd0a32829bc07f   |   MISC:https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.14   |   URL:https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.14   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20220512 CVE-2022-29162: runc < 1.1.2 incorrect handling of inheritable capabilities in default configuration   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/12/1",Assigned (20220210),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-24778,Candidate,"The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-8v99-48m9-c8pm   |   URL:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-8v99-48m9-c8pm   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-5f746c8e5b   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFTJR5CR5EOYDVOSBZEMLBHLJRTPJPUA/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-d86c15bfb7   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4SJUNSC7YZLA745EMKWK2GKEV57GE52K/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-de0f8beeb0   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TAHAAOOA3KZJC2I5WHCR3XVBJBNWTWUE/   |   MISC:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/commit/6fdd9818a4d8142107b7ecd767d839c9707700d9   |   URL:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/commit/6fdd9818a4d8142107b7ecd767d839c9707700d9   |   MISC:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/issues/69   |   URL:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/issues/69   |   MISC:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/releases/tag/v1.1.4   |   URL:https://github.com/containerd/imgcrypt/releases/tag/v1.1.4",Assigned (20220210),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-24791,Candidate,"Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift. There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when both running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected. The use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order, rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references, which is a use after free. Patches have been released in versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2, which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime users are recommended to upgrade to these patched versions.

A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver instead.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-p6g5-v97c-w5q4   |   URL:https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-p6g5-v97c-w5q4   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5285   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202210-37   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37   |   MISC:https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/9fae8f43accef8ea65d4a8ae9cdf297c46cfe29a   |   URL:https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/9fae8f43accef8ea65d4a8ae9cdf297c46cfe29a   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20220531 [SECURITY] [DLA 3036-1] pjproject security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00047.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20221117 [SECURITY] [DLA 3194-1] asterisk security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html",Assigned (20220210),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-24795,Candidate,"yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2.

CVE-2022-24826,Candidate,"On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a `..exe` file as well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems. Similarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe` and `cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed when certain Git LFS commands are run. More generally, if the current working directory contains any file with a base name of `.` and a file extension from `PATHEXT` (except `.bat` and `.cmd`), and also contains another file with the same base name as a program Git LFS intends to execute (such as `git`, `cygpath`, or `uname`) and any file extension from `PATHEXT` (including `.bat` and `.cmd`), then, on Windows, when Git LFS attempts to execute the intended program the `..exe`, `..com`, etc., file will be executed instead, but only if the intended program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH`. The vulnerability occurs because when Git LFS detects that the program it intends to run does not exist in any directory listed in `PATH` then Git LFS passes an empty string as the executable file path to the Go `os/exec` package, which contains a bug such that, on Windows, it prepends the name of the current working directory (i.e., `.`) to the empty string without adding a path separator, and as a result searches in that directory for a file with the base name `.` combined with any file extension from `PATHEXT`, executing the first one it finds. (The reason `..bat` and `..cmd` files are not executed in the same manner is that, although the Go `os/exec` package tries to execute them just as it does a `..exe` file, the Microsoft Win32 API `CreateProcess()` family of functions have an undocumented feature in that they apparently recognize when a caller is attempting to execute a batch script file and instead run the `cmd.exe` command interpreter, passing the full set of command line arguments as parameters. These are unchanged from the command line arguments set by Git LFS, and as such, the intended program's name is the first, resulting in a command line like `cmd.exe /c git`, which then fails.) Git LFS has resolved this vulnerability by always reporting an error when a program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH` rather than passing an empty string to the Go `os/exec` package in this case. The bug in the Go `os/exec` package has been reported to the Go project and is expected to be patched after this security advisory is published. The problem was introduced in version 2.12.1 and is patched in version 3.1.3. Users of affected versions should upgrade to version 3.1.3.

CVE-2022-24832,Candidate,"GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries.
