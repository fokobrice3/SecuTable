CVE-2019-14889,Candidate,"A flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh_scp_new() in versions before 0.9.3 and before 0.8.8.

In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote target.","CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14889   |   URL:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14889   |   CONFIRM:https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2019-14889.txt   |   URL:https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2019-14889.txt   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-46b6bd2459   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EV2ONSPDJCTDVORCB4UGRQUZQQ46JHRN/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-8b0ad69829   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7JJWJTXVWLLJTVHBPGWL7472S5FWXYQR/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202003-27   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-27   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20191217 [SECURITY] [DLA 2038-1] libssh security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/12/msg00020.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2689   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00033.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0102   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00047.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4219-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4219-1/",Assigned (20190810),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
