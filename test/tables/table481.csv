This vulnerability does not expose applications that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different RedirectResolver implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver, act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer), act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient).","BID:107153   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107153   |   CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3778   |   URL:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3778   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153299/Spring-Security-OAuth-2.3-Open-Redirection.html   |   URL:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153299/Spring-Security-OAuth-2.3-Open-Redirection.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html",Assigned (20190103),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
