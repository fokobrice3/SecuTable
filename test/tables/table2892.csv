CVE-2019-18641,HIGH,Rock RMS before 1.8.6 mishandles vCard access control within the People/GetVCard/REST controller.
CVE-2019-18642,HIGH,"Rock RMS version before 8.6 is vulnerable to account takeover by tampering with the user ID parameter in the profile update feature. The lack of validation and use of sequential user IDs allows any user to change account details of any other user. This vulnerability could be used to change the email address of another account, even the administrator account. Upon changing another account's email address, performing a password reset to the new email address could allow an attacker to take over any account."
CVE-2019-18643,HIGH,Rock RMS versions before 8.10 and versions 9.0 through 9.3 fails to properly validate files uploaded in the application. The only protection mechanism is a file-extension blacklist that can be bypassed by adding multiple spaces and periods after the file name. This could allow an attacker to upload ASPX code and gain remote code execution on the application. The application typically runs as LocalSystem as mandated in the installation guide. Patched in versions 8.10 and 9.4.

CVE-2019-18658,HIGH,"In Helm 2.x before 2.15.2, commands that deal with loading a chart as a directory or packaging a chart provide an opportunity for a maliciously designed chart to include sensitive content such as /etc/passwd, or to execute a denial of service (DoS) via a special file such as /dev/urandom, via symlinks. No version of Tiller is known to be impacted. This is a client-only issue."
CVE-2019-18659,MEDIUM,"The Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) protocol allows remote attackers to spoof a Presidential Alert because cryptographic authentication is not used, as demonstrated by MessageIdentifier 4370 in LTE System Information Block 12 (aka SIB12). NOTE: testing inside an RF-isolated shield box suggested that all LTE phones are affected by design (e.g., use of Android versus iOS does not matter); testing in an open RF environment is, of course, contraindicated."
CVE-2019-1866,MEDIUM,"Cisco Webex Business Suite before 39.1.0 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of the application. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of host header values. An attacker with a privileged network position, either a man-in-the-middle or by intercepting wireless network traffic, could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate header values sent by a client to the affected application. The attacker could cause the application to use input from the header to redirect a user from the Cisco Webex Meetings Online site to an arbitrary site of the attacker's choosing."

User input passed through the live_stream_code POST parameter to /plugin/LiveChat/getChat.json.php is not properly sanitized (in getFromChat in plugin/LiveChat/Objects/LiveChatObj.php) before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious users to, e.g., read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection attacks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the Live Chat plugin to be enabled."
CVE-2019-18663,HIGH,A SQL injection vulnerability in a /login/forgot1 POST request in ARP-GUARD 4.0.0-5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the user_id parameter.
CVE-2019-18664,LOW,The Log module in SECUDOS DOMOS before 5.6 allows XSS.
CVE-2019-18665,MEDIUM,The Log module in SECUDOS DOMOS before 5.6 allows local file inclusion.
CVE-2019-18666,HIGH,"An issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1360 revision F devices. Remote attackers can start a telnet service without authorization via an undocumented HTTP request. Although this is the primary vulnerability, the impact depends on the firmware version. Versions 609EU through 613EUbeta were tested. Versions through 6.12b01 have weak root credentials, allowing an attacker to gain remote root access. After 6.12b01, the root credentials were changed but the telnet service can still be started without authorization."
CVE-2019-18667,MEDIUM,/usr/local/www/freeradius_view_config.php in the freeradius3 package before 0.15.7_3 for pfSense on FreeBSD allows a user with an XSS payload as password or username to execute arbitrary javascript code on a victim browser.
CVE-2019-18668,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in the Currency Switcher addon before 2.11.2 for WooCommerce if a user provides a currency that was not added by the administrator. In this case, even though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but a price amount will fall back to the default currency. This means that if an attacker provides a currency that does not exist and is worth less than this default, the attacker can eventually purchase an item for a significantly cheaper price."
CVE-2019-1867,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on the REST API. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges on an affected system."
CVE-2019-18670,MEDIUM,"In the Quick Access Service (QAAdminAgent.exe) in Acer Quick Access V2.01.3000 through 2.01.3027 and V3.00.3000 through V3.00.3008, a REGULAR user can load an arbitrary unsigned DLL into the signed service's process, which is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This is a DLL Hijacking vulnerability (including search order hijacking, which searches for the missing DLL in the PATH environment variable), which is caused by an uncontrolled search path element for nvapi.dll, atiadlxx.dll, or atiadlxy.dll."
CVE-2019-18671,HIGH,Insufficient checks in the USB packet handling of the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet before firmware 6.2.2 allow out-of-bounds writes in the .bss segment via crafted messages. The vulnerability could allow code execution or other forms of impact. It can be triggered by unauthenticated attackers and the interface is reachable via WebUSB.
CVE-2019-18672,MEDIUM,"Insufficient checks in the finite state machine of the ShapeShift KeepKey hardware wallet before firmware 6.2.2 allow a partial reset of cryptographic secrets to known values via crafted messages. Notably, this breaks the security of U2F for new server registrations and invalidates existing registrations. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers and the interface is reachable via WebUSB."
CVE-2019-18673,LOW,"On SHIFT BitBox02 devices, a side channel for the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. Note: BIP39 secrets are not displayed by default on this device. The side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data."
CVE-2019-18674,MEDIUM,An issue was discovered in Joomla! before 3.9.13. A missing access check in the phputf8 mapping files could lead to a path disclosure.
CVE-2019-18675,HIGH,"The Linux kernel through 5.3.13 has a start_offset+size Integer Overflow in cpia2_remap_buffer in drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_core.c because cpia2 has its own mmap implementation. This allows local users (with /dev/video0 access) to obtain read and write permissions on kernel physical pages, which can possibly result in a privilege escalation."
CVE-2019-18676,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme."
CVE-2019-18677,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8 when the append_domain setting is used (because the appended characters do not properly interact with hostname length restrictions). Due to incorrect message processing, it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins it should not be delivered to."
CVE-2019-18678,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. It allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated to software between the attacker client and Squid. There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers. The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace between a header name and a colon."
CVE-2019-18679,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect data management, it is vulnerable to information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication. Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target for remote code execution attacks."
CVE-2019-1868,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system information. The vulnerability is due to improper access control to files within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive system information."
CVE-2019-18680,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4.x before 4.4.195. There is a NULL pointer dereference in rds_tcp_kill_sock() in net/rds/tcp.c that will cause denial of service, aka CID-91573ae4aed0."
CVE-2019-18683,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in drivers/media/platform/vivid in the Linux kernel through 5.3.8. It is exploitable for privilege escalation on some Linux distributions where local users have /dev/video0 access, but only if the driver happens to be loaded. There are multiple race conditions during streaming stopping in this driver (part of the V4L2 subsystem). These issues are caused by wrong mutex locking in vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap(), vivid_stop_generating_vid_out(), sdr_cap_stop_streaming(), and the corresponding kthreads. At least one of these race conditions leads to a use-after-free."
CVE-2019-18684,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write ""ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers."
