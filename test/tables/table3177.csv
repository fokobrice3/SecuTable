The e-mail address requested by the password recovery module on the resetpw.php page.

So an e-mail address can be provided that includes the special character ' to break the SQL query below (and it will not be rejected by the regular expression because of the null byte trick). So a SQL injection becomes possible: $get_info=mysql_query(select * from banneruser whereemail='$email' ); This query will return a non-zero result set even though the email supplied (attacker's email) is not in the database.

The device claims in logs, stats, and via the display panel to be pumping out very large quantities of network traffic, when it is in fact putting out very low volumes. The developed product is adjusted and configured to handle what it believes to be a heavy network load, but when deployed at the victim site the large volumes of network traffic are dropped instead of being processed by the network security device. This allows the adversary an advantage when attacking the victim in that the adversary's presence may not be detected by the device.::","","TAXONOMY NAME:ATTACK:ENTRY ID:1195.003:ENTRY NAME:Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain::","",

The problem specifically exists upon retrieving a link of the following form: GET /any_existing_dir/any_existing_pdf.pdf%00[long string] HTTP/1.1 Where [long string] is a malicious crafted long string containing acceptable URI characters. The request must be made to a web server that truncates the request at the null byte (%00), otherwise an invalid file name is specified and a file not found page will be returned. Example web servers that truncate the requested URI include Microsoft IIS and Netscape Enterprise. Though the requested URI is truncated for the purposes of locating the file the long string is still passed to the Adobe ActiveX component responsible for rendering the page. This in turn triggers a buffer overflow within RTLHeapFree() allowing for an adversary to overwrite an arbitrary word in memory. The responsible instructions from RTLHeapFree() are shown here: 0x77F83AE5 MOV EAX,[EDI+8]0x77F83AE8 MOV ECX,[EDI+C]...0x77F83AED MOV [ECX],EAX The register EDI contains a pointer to a user-supplied string. The adversary therefore has control over both the ECX and EAX registers used in the shown MOV instruction. Successful exploitation allows remote adversaries to utilize the arbitrary word overwrite to redirect the flow of control and eventually take control of the affected system. Code execution will occur under the context of the user that instantiated the vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat. An adversary does not need to establish a malicious web site as exploitation can occur by adding malicious content to the end of any embedded link and referencing any Microsoft IIS or Netscape Enterprise web server. Clicking on a direct malicious link is also not required as it may be embedded within an IMAGE tag, an IFRAME or an auto-loading script. Successful exploitation requires that a payload be written such that certain areas of the input are URI acceptable.
