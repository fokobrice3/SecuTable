CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2019-8956,HIGH,"In the Linux Kernel before versions 4.20.8 and 4.19.21 a use-after-free error in the ""sctp_sendmsg()"" function (net/sctp/socket.c) when handling SCTP_SENDALL flag can be exploited to corrupt memory."
CVE-2019-8960,MEDIUM,"A Denial of Service vulnerability related to command handling has been identified in FlexNet Publisher lmadmin.exe version 11.16.2. The message reading function used in lmadmin.exe can, given a certain message, call itself again and then wait for a further message. With a particular flag set in the original message, but no second message received, the function eventually return an unexpected value which leads to an exception being thrown. The end result can be process termination."
CVE-2019-8961,MEDIUM,"A Denial of Service vulnerability related to stack exhaustion has been identified in FlexNet Publisher lmadmin.exe 11.16.2. Because the message reading function calls itself recursively given a certain condition in the received message, an unauthenticated remote attacker can repeatedly send messages of that type to cause a stack exhaustion condition."
CVE-2019-8978,MEDIUM,"An improper authentication vulnerability can be exploited through a race condition that occurs in Ellucian Banner Web Tailor 8.8.3, 8.8.4, and 8.9 and Banner Enterprise Identity Services 8.3, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, and 8.4, in conjunction with SSO Manager. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to steal a victim's session (and cause a denial of service) by repeatedly requesting the initial Banner Web Tailor main page with the IDMSESSID cookie set to the victim's UDCID, which in the case tested is the institutional ID. During a login attempt by a victim, the attacker can leverage the race condition and will be issued the SESSID that was meant for this victim."
