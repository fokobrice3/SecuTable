CVE-2010-2942,LOW,"The actions implementation in the network queueing functionality in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc2 does not properly initialize certain structure members when performing dump operations, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory via vectors related to (1) the tcf_gact_dump function in net/sched/act_gact.c, (2) the tcf_mirred_dump function in net/sched/act_mirred.c, (3) the tcf_nat_dump function in net/sched/act_nat.c, (4) the tcf_simp_dump function in net/sched/act_simple.c, and (5) the tcf_skbedit_dump function in net/sched/act_skbedit.c."
CVE-2010-2943,MEDIUM,"The xfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 does not look up inode allocation btrees before reading inode buffers, which allows remote authenticated users to read unlinked files, or read or overwrite disk blocks that are currently assigned to an active file but were previously assigned to an unlinked file, by accessing a stale NFS filehandle."
CVE-2010-2944,HIGH,"The authenticate function in LDAPUserFolder/LDAPUserFolder.py in zope-ldapuserfolder 2.9-1 does not verify the password for the emergency account, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges."
CVE-2010-2945,MEDIUM,"The default configuration of SLiM before 1.3.2 places ./ (dot slash) at the beginning of the default_path option, which might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse program in the current working directory, related to slim.conf and cfg.cpp."
CVE-2010-2946,LOW,"fs/jfs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35.2 does not properly handle a certain legacy format for storage of extended attributes, which might allow local users by bypass intended xattr namespace restrictions via an ""os2."" substring at the beginning of a name."
CVE-2010-2947,HIGH,Heap-based buffer overflow in the HX_split function in string.c in libHX before 3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a string that is inconsistent with the expected number of fields.
CVE-2010-2948,MEDIUM,Stack-based buffer overflow in the bgp_route_refresh_receive function in bgp_packet.c in bgpd in Quagga before 0.99.17 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) record in a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH (RR) message.
CVE-2010-2949,MEDIUM,"bgpd in Quagga before 0.99.17 does not properly parse AS paths, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unknown AS type in an AS path attribute in a BGP UPDATE message."
CVE-2010-2950,MEDIUM,"Format string vulnerability in stream.c in the phar extension in PHP 5.3.x through 5.3.3 allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted phar:// URI that is not properly handled by the phar_stream_flush function, leading to errors in the php_stream_wrapper_log_error function.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-2094."
CVE-2010-2951,MEDIUM,"dns_internal.cc in Squid 3.1.6, when IPv6 DNS resolution is not enabled, accesses an invalid socket during an IPv4 TCP DNS query, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via vectors that trigger an IPv4 DNS response with the TC bit set."
CVE-2010-2952,MEDIUM,"Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable, does not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and does not properly use DNS query fields to validate responses, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to poison the internal DNS cache via a crafted response."
CVE-2010-2953,MEDIUM,Untrusted search path vulnerability in a certain Debian GNU/Linux patch for the couchdb script in CouchDB 0.8.0 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted shared library in the current working directory.
CVE-2010-2954,MEDIUM,"The irda_bind function in net/irda/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc3-next-20100901 does not properly handle failure of the irda_open_tsap function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF_IRDA (aka PF_IRDA) socket."
CVE-2010-2955,LOW,"The cfg80211_wext_giwessid function in net/wireless/wext-compat.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc3-next-20100831 does not properly initialize certain structure members, which allows local users to leverage an off-by-one error in the ioctl_standard_iw_point function in net/wireless/wext-core.c, and obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel heap memory, via vectors involving an SIOCGIWESSID ioctl call that specifies a large buffer size."
CVE-2010-2956,MEDIUM,"Sudo 1.7.0 through 1.7.4p3, when a Runas group is configured, does not properly handle use of the -u option in conjunction with the -g option, which allows local users to gain privileges via a command line containing a ""-u root"" sequence."
