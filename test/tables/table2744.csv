CVE-2016-9937,MEDIUM,An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x before 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
CVE-2016-9938,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1, 13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you."
CVE-2016-9939,MEDIUM,"Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused. There is a noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation."
CVE-2016-9941,HIGH,Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer before 0.9.11 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the client drawing area.
CVE-2016-9942,HIGH,"Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer before 0.9.11 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO payload decompressed length exceeds what is specified by the tile dimensions."
CVE-2016-9949,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. In apport/ui.py, Apport reads the CrashDB field and it then evaluates the field as Python code if it begins with a ""{"". This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Python code."
CVE-2016-9950,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path traversal issue in the Apport crash file ""Package"" and ""SourcePackage"" fields. These fields are used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An attacker can exploit this path traversal to execute arbitrary Python files from the local system."
CVE-2016-9951,MEDIUM,An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. A malicious Apport crash file can contain a restart command in `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields. This command will be executed if a user clicks the Relaunch button on the Apport prompt from the malicious crash file. The fix is to only show the Relaunch button on Apport crash files generated by local systems. The Relaunch button will be hidden when crash files are opened directly in Apport-GTK.
CVE-2016-9952,MEDIUM,"The verify_certificate function in lib/vtls/schannel.c in libcurl 7.30.0 through 7.51.0, when built for Windows CE using the schannel TLS backend, makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted wildcard SAN in a server certificate, as demonstrated by ""*.com."""
