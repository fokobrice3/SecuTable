NOTE: this has security relevance only in use cases outside of the MIT Kerberos distribution, e.g., the use of get_matching_data in KDC certauth plugin code that is specific to Red Hat."
CVE-2017-15089,MEDIUM,"It was found that the Hotrod client in Infinispan before 9.2.0.CR1 would unsafely read deserialized data on information from the cache.

CVE-2017-1509,MEDIUM,IBM Jazz Foundation products could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information from a stack trace that could be used to aid future attacks. IBM X-Force ID: 129719.
CVE-2017-15090,MEDIUM,"An issue has been found in the DNSSEC validation component of PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 and up to and including 4.0.6, where the signatures might have been accepted as valid even if the signed data was not in bailiwick of the DNSKEY used to sign it. This allows an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of records by issuing a valid signature for the crafted records."
CVE-2017-15091,MEDIUM,"An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative 4.x up to and including 4.0.4 and 3.x up to and including 3.4.11, where some operations that have an impact on the state of the server are still allowed even though the API has been configured as read-only via the api-readonly keyword. This missing check allows an attacker with valid API credentials to flush the cache, trigger a zone transfer or send a NOTIFY."
CVE-2017-15092,MEDIUM,"A cross-site scripting issue has been found in the web interface of PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6, where the qname of DNS queries was displayed without any escaping, allowing a remote attacker to inject HTML and Javascript code into the web interface, altering the content."
CVE-2017-15093,LOW,"When api-config-dir is set to a non-empty value, which is not the case by default, the API in PowerDNS Recursor 4.x up to and including 4.0.6 and 3.x up to and including 3.7.4 allows an authorized user to update the Recursor's ACL by adding and removing netmasks, and to configure forward zones. It was discovered that the new netmask and IP addresses of forwarded zones were not sufficiently validated, allowing an authenticated user to inject new configuration directives into the Recursor's configuration."
CVE-2017-15094,MEDIUM,An issue has been found in the DNSSEC parsing code of PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.6 leading to a memory leak when parsing specially crafted DNSSEC ECDSA keys. These keys are only parsed when validation is enabled by setting dnssec to a value other than off or process-no-validate (default).

CVE-2017-15105,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in the way unbound before 1.6.8 validated wildcard-synthesized NSEC records. An improperly validated wildcard NSEC record could be used to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard record, or trick unbound into accepting a NODATA proof."
CVE-2017-15107,MEDIUM,A vulnerability was found in the implementation of DNSSEC in Dnsmasq up to and including 2.78. Wildcard synthesized NSEC records could be improperly interpreted to prove the non-existence of hostnames that actually exist.
CVE-2017-15108,MEDIUM,"spice-vdagent up to and including 0.17.0 does not properly escape save directory before passing to shell, allowing local attacker with access to the session the agent runs in to inject arbitrary commands to be executed."
