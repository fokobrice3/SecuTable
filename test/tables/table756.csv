CVE-2020-3589,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.","CISCO:20201007 Cisco Identity Services Engine Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxs-mf5cbYx5",Assigned (20191212),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
