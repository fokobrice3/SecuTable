CVE-2019-1590,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate validation functionality of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform insecure TLS client authentication on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient TLS client certificate validations for certificates sent between the various components of an ACI fabric. An attacker who has possession of a certificate that is trusted by the Cisco Manufacturing CA and the corresponding private key could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a valid certificate while attempting to connect to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain full control of all other components within the ACI fabric of an affected device.","CISCO:20190501 Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches Application Centric Infrastructure Mode Insecure Fabric Authentication Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-aci-insecure-fabric",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-16000,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the automatic update process of Cisco Umbrella Roaming Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install arbitrary, unapproved applications on a targeted device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of the Windows Installer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a file in a specific location in the Windows file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured policy and install unapproved applications.","CISCO:20200122 Cisco Umbrella Roaming Client for Windows Install Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-umbrella-msi-install",Assigned (20190906),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-16001,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the vulnerable application is launched. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user account.","CISCO:20191120 Cisco Webex Teams for Windows DLL Hijacking Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-webex-teams-dll",Assigned (20190906),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-16002,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the vManage web-based UI (web UI) of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected instance of vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.","CISCO:20191120 Cisco SD-WAN Solution vManage Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-vman-csrf",Assigned (20190906),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-16003,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download system log files from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an issue in the authentication logic of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download log files if they were previously generated by an administrator.","CISCO:20200108 Cisco UCS Director Information Disclosure Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-ucs-dir-infodis",Assigned (20190906),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
