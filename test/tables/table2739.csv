CVE-2016-8525,MEDIUM,A Remote Disclosure of Information vulnerability in HPE iMC PLAT version v7.2 E0403P06 and earlier was found. The problem was resolved in iMC PLAT 7.3 E0504 or subsequent version.
CVE-2016-8526,MEDIUM,"Aruba Airwave all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1 is vulnerable to an XML external entities (XXE). XXEs are a way to permit XML parsers to access storage that exist on external systems. If an unprivileged user is permitted to control the contents of XML files, XXE can be used as an attack vector. Because the XML parser has access to the local filesystem and runs with the permissions of the web server, it can access any file that is readable by the web server and copy it to an external system of the attacker's choosing. This could include files that contain passwords, which could then lead to privilege escalation."
CVE-2016-8527,MEDIUM,"Aruba Airwave all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

CVE-2016-8743,MEDIUM,"Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution."
CVE-2016-8744,HIGH,"Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs. SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java type available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files and network connections, and execute system commands. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability."
CVE-2016-8745,MEDIUM,"A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions."
