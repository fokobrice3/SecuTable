Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints.

Then, the attacker could easily ignore the allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` would cause an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the value.
