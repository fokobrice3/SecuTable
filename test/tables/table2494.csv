CVE-2007-3303,Apache,2008-07-02,Mark J Cox,"In the security model used by Apache httpd, the less-privileged child processes completely handle the servicing of new connections. Any local user who is able to run arbitrary code in those children is therefore able to prevent new requests from being serviced, by design.  Such
users will also be able to &quot;simulate&quot; server load and force the parent to create children up to the configured limits, by design.

A server with untrusted local users must be configured to use a solution like &quot;suexec&quot; if its required to allow the users to execute CGI (etc) scripts."
