CVE-2009-3229,Red Hat,2009-09-24,Tomas Hoger,"Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of PostgreSQL as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5.

In PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.2, only database administrator was able to LOAD additional plugins and use it to cause server crash.  However, this does not bypass trust boundary, so its not a security flaw for older PostgreSQL versions.  Additionally, no plugins are shipped in Red Hat PostgreSQL packages by default.

This issue was addressed in Red Hat Application Stack v2 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1461.html ."
