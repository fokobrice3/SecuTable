CVE-2017-15710,Candidate,"In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.","BID:103512   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103512   |   CONFIRM:https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180601-0004/   |   CONFIRM:https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbux03909en_us   |   CONFIRM:https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-09   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4164   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4164   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20180530 [SECURITY] [DLA 1389-1] apache2 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/05/msg00020.html   |   MLIST:[httpd-cvs] 20190815 svn commit: r1048742 [4/4] -
