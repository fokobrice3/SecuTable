However, they also link this issue to  |    SCO advisory 99.17, although the advisory itself is too vague  |    to *really* know what vulns they fixed.  And now the link  |    to a potentially more detailed document (sse037.ltr)  |    is broken.  So we don't have any independent reason for  |    knowing whether SCO 99.17 (a) addresses any ""sar""  |    vulnerabilities, and (b) even if it does, whether it addresses  |    *both* the -o and -f arguments originally claimed by Tellier.  |    Finally, it seems rather curious that CSSA-2002-SCO.17  |    talks about a -o overflow but does not mention -f.  |    Sounds like an email to the security people at SCO  |    is in order...  |      |    OK.  Having consulted with SCO (who responded quickly), I  |    looked even further into this issue.  There is now sufficient  |    evidence that the -f overflow was fixed in 1999.
