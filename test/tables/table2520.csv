CVE-2008-1628,Red Hat,2008-04-04,Mark J Cox,"This issue did not affect the audit packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

Red Hat is not treating this issue as a security vulnerability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as no application used the affected interface, and the only result is a controlled application termination as the overflow is detected by the FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism.  We plan to address this as non-security bug fix in updated audit packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2.
