CVE-2019-15948,MEDIUM,"Texas Instruments CC256x and WL18xx dual-mode Bluetooth controller devices, when LE scan mode is used, allow remote attackers to trigger a buffer overflow via a malformed Bluetooth Low Energy advertising packet, to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. This affects CC256xC-BT-SP 1.2, CC256xB-BT-SP 1.8, and WL18xx-BT-SP 4.4."
CVE-2019-15949,HIGH,"Nagios XI before 5.6.6 allows remote command execution as root. The exploit requires access to the server as the nagios user, or access as the admin user via the web interface. The getprofile.sh script, invoked by downloading a system profile (profile.php?cmd=download), is executed as root via a passwordless sudo entry; the script executes check_plugin, which is owned by the nagios user. A user logged into Nagios XI with permissions to modify plugins, or the nagios user on the server, can modify the check_plugin executable and insert malicious commands to execute as root."
CVE-2019-1595,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
