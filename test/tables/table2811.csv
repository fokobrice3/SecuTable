This vulnerability occurs because an attacker is able to adjust the ""HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions"" parameter and add arbitrary extensions to the whitelist during the upload. For instance, if the extension .asp is added to the ""HiddenFieldControlCustomWhiteListedExtensions"" parameter, the server accepts ""secctest.asp"" as a legitimate file.

CVE-2018-11101,MEDIUM,"Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content in the reply (it doesn't matter)."

CVE-2018-1121,MEDIUM,"procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries.
