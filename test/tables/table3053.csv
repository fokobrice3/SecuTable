CVE-2021-43960,LOW,"** DISPUTED ** Lorensbergs Connect2 3.13.7647.20190 is affected by an XSS vulnerability. Exploitation requires administrator privileges and is performed through the Wizard editor of the application. The attack requires an administrator to go into the Wizard editor and enter an XSS payload within the Page title, Page Instructions, Text before, Text after, or Text on side box. Once this has been done, the administrator must click save and finally wait until any user of the application performs a booking for rental items in the booking area of the application, where the XSS triggers. NOTE: another perspective is that the administrator may require JavaScript to customize any aspect of the page rendering. There is no effective way for the product to defend users in the face of a malicious administrator."

CVE-2021-43979,MEDIUM,"** DISPUTED ** Styra Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper through 3.7.0 mishandles concurrency, sometimes resulting in incorrect access control. The data replication mechanism allows policies to access the Kubernetes cluster state. During data replication, OPA/Gatekeeper does not wait for the replication to finish before processing a request, which might cause inconsistencies between the replicated resources in OPA/Gatekeeper and the resources actually present in the cluster. Inconsistency can later be reflected in a policy bypass. NOTE: the vendor disagrees that this is a vulnerability, because Kubernetes states are only eventually consistent."

CVE-2021-44421,LOW,The pointer-validation logic in util/mem_util.rs in Occlum before 0.26.0 for Intel SGX acts as a confused deputy that allows a local attacker to access unauthorized information via side-channel analysis.
CVE-2021-44422,MEDIUM,"An Improper Input Validation Vulnerability exists when reading a BMP file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.12. Crafted data in a BMP file can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer, or lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."
CVE-2021-44423,MEDIUM,An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists when reading a BMP file using Open Design Alliance (ODA) Drawings Explorer before 2022.12. The specific issue exists after loading BMP files. Unchecked input data from a crafted BMP file leads to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
