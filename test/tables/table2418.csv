The affected code is present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, however lppasswd is not shipped setuid so is not vulnerable to this issue. If a user were to enable the setuid bit on lppasswd, the impact would only be a crash of lppasswd due to use of FORTIFY_SOURCE protections. Therefore, there are no plans to correct this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5."
