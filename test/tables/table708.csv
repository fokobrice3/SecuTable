CVE-2020-26230,Candidate,"Radar COVID is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for Spain. In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server is possible. This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test. Such an adversary can be the mobile network operator (MNO) if the connection is done through a mobile network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the connection is done through the Internet (e.g., a home network), a VPN provider used by the user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise networks, or any eavesdropper with access to the same network (WiFi or Ethernet) as the user as could be the case of public WiFi hotspots deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee shops. The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without encryption). The former can be executed, for instance, by the Internet Service Provider or the MNO. The latter can be executed by any on-path adversary, such as the network provider or even the cloud provider that hosts more than one service accessed by the victim. The farther the adversary is either from the victim (the client) or the end-point (the server), the less likely it may be that the adversary has access to re-identification information. The vulnerability has been mitigated with the injection of dummy traffic from the application to the backend. Dummy traffic is generated by all users independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. The issue was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Android in version 1.0.7 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Backend in version 1.1.2-RELEASE.

CVE-2020-26236,Candidate,"In ScratchVerifier before commit a603769, an attacker can hijack the verification process to log into someone else's account on any site that uses ScratchVerifier for logins. A possible exploitation would follow these steps: 1. User starts login process. 2. Attacker attempts login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can, attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented. 5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process as soon as possible after commenting the code.

CVE-2020-26241,Candidate,"Go Ethereum, or ""Geth"", is the official Golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth before version 1.9.17 which can be used to cause a chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled dataCopy (at 0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region R, then calls 0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y, and finally invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode. When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack, whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed in version 1.9.17.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-69v6-xc2j-r2jf   |   URL:https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-69v6-xc2j-r2jf   |   MISC:https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/12/geth_security_release/   |   URL:https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/12/geth_security_release/",Assigned (20201001),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.3.6, and Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 there is a vulnerability in which the admin panel may be accessed if hosted on a .dev domain. In order to protect new installations on public servers that don't have an admin account for the Panel yet, we block account registration there by default. This is a security feature, which we implemented years ago in Kirby 2. It helps to avoid that you forget registering your first admin account on a public server. In this case &#8211; without our security block &#8211; someone else might theoretically be able to find your site, find out it's running on Kirby, find the Panel and then register the account first. It's an unlikely situation, but it's still a certain risk. To be able to register the first Panel account on a public server, you have to enforce the installer via a config setting. This helps to push all users to the best practice of registering your first Panel account on your local machine and upload it together with the rest of the site. This installation block implementation in Kirby versions before 3.3.6 still assumed that .dev domains are local domains, which is no longer true. In the meantime, those domains became publicly available. This means that our installation block is no longer working as expected if you use a .dev domain for your Kirby site. Additionally the local installation check may also fail if your site is behind a reverse proxy. You are only affected if you use a .dev domain or your site is behind a reverse proxy and you have not yet registered your first Panel account on the public server and someone finds your site and tries to login at `yourdomain.dev/panel` before you register your first account. You are not affected if you have already created one or multiple Panel accounts (no matter if on a .dev domain or behind a reverse proxy). The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.3.6.

CVE-2020-26257,Candidate,"Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. Synapse is a reference ""homeserver"" implementation of Matrix. A malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the federation API to trusted servers (for example via `federation_domain_whitelist`).","CONFIRM:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-a2172c484d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QR4MMYZKX5N5GYGH4H5LBUUC5TLAFHI7/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-eeb66c2ece   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DBTIU3ZNBFWZ56V4X7JIAD33V5H2GOMC/   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CHANGES.md#synapse-1231-2020-12-09   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CHANGES.md#synapse-1231-2020-12-09   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3ce2f303f15f6ac3dc352298972dc6e04d9b7a8b   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3ce2f303f15f6ac3dc352298972dc6e04d9b7a8b   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8776   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8776",Assigned (20201001),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
