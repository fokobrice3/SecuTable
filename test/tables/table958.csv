CVE-2021-32617,Candidate,"Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-w8mv-g8qq-36mj   |   URL:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-w8mv-g8qq-36mj   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8253c78bd7   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M2BPQNJKTRIDINTVJ22QMMTIZEPHVKXK/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8917c5d9d2   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TZ5SGWHK64TB7ADRSVBGHEPDFN5CSOO3/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-bdba47348c   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQAKFIQHW2AS3AGSJM42ABOA6CWIJBGM/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-d1d5a0bf0f   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5I3RRZUGSBIUYZ5TIHLN55PKMAWCSJ5G/   |   MISC:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1657   |   URL:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1657",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-32618,Candidate,"The Python ""Flask-Security-Too"" package is used for adding security features to your Flask application. It is an is an independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. All versions of Flask-Security-Too allow redirects after many successful views (e.g. /login) by honoring the ?next query param. There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting http://login?next=\\\github.com will pass FS's relative URL check however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com. Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want. This is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug is used (which is very common with Flask applications) as the WSGI layer, it by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus making this attack vector mute. It is possible for application writers to modify this default behavior by setting the 'autocorrect_location_header=False`.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-6qmf-fj6m-686c   |   URL:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-6qmf-fj6m-686c   |   MISC:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/issues/486   |   URL:https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/issues/486",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-32629,Candidate,"Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32&#8217;s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value&#8217;s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be &#8220;special&#8221; in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

CVE-2021-32638,Candidate,"Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/security/advisories/GHSA-g36v-2xff-pv5m   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/security/advisories/GHSA-g36v-2xff-pv5m   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db   |   MISC:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20210304   |   URL:https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20210304   |   MISC:https://www.netmeister.org/blog/passing-passwords.html   |   URL:https://www.netmeister.org/blog/passing-passwords.html",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-32675,Candidate,"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates memory according to user-specified values which determine the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication requests, this vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or Enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-f6pw-v9gw-v64p   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-f6pw-v9gw-v64p   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211104-0003/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211104-0003/   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5001   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5001   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-61c487f241   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HTYQ5ZF37HNGTZWVNJD3VXP7I6MEEF42/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8913c7900c   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VL5KXFN3ATM7IIM7Q4O4PWTSRGZ5744Z/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-aa94492a09   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WR5WKJWXD4D6S3DJCZ56V74ESLTDQRAB/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202209-17   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-17   |   MISC:https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/5674b0057ff2903d43eaff802017eddf37c360f8   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/5674b0057ff2903d43eaff802017eddf37c360f8   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   MLIST:[geode-notifications] 20211013 [GitHub] [geode] jdeppe-pivotal opened a new pull request #6994: GEODE-9676: Limit array and string sizes for unauthenticated Radish connections   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra603ff6e04549d7f290f61f9b11e2d2e4dba693b05ff053f4ec6bc47@%3Cnotifications.geode.apache.org%3E",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json.

When the `{% include_block %}` template tag is used to output the value of a plain-text StreamField block (`CharBlock`, `TextBlock` or a similar user-defined block derived from `FieldBlock`), and that block does not specify a template for rendering, the tag output is not properly escaped as HTML.

CVE-2021-32687,Candidate,"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents of the heap or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate sets. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-m3mf-8x9w-r27q   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-m3mf-8x9w-r27q   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211104-0003/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211104-0003/   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5001   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5001   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-61c487f241   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HTYQ5ZF37HNGTZWVNJD3VXP7I6MEEF42/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-8913c7900c   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VL5KXFN3ATM7IIM7Q4O4PWTSRGZ5744Z/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-aa94492a09   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WR5WKJWXD4D6S3DJCZ56V74ESLTDQRAB/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202209-17   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-17   |   MISC:https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/a30d367a71b7017581cf1ca104242a3c644dec0f   |   URL:https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/a30d367a71b7017581cf1ca104242a3c644dec0f   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
