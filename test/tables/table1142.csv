This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220715-0010/   |   CONFIRM:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220705.txt   |   CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=4d8a88c134df634ba610ff8db1eb8478ac5fd345   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=4d8a88c134df634ba610ff8db1eb8478ac5fd345   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/18625   |   URL:https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/18625",Assigned (20220630),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
