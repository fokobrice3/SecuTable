There are three common ways for SSL to be bypassed: A user manually enters URL and types HTTP rather than HTTPS. Attackers intentionally send a user to an insecure URL. A programmer erroneously creates a relative link to a page in the application, which does not switch from HTTP to HTTPS. (This is particularly easy to do when the link moves between public and secured areas on a web site.)::"
6,J2EE Misconfiguration: Insufficient Session-ID Length,Variant,Incomplete,The J2EE application is configured to use an insufficient session ID length.,"If an attacker can guess or steal a session ID, then they may be able to take over the user's session (called session hijacking). The number of possible session IDs increases with increased session ID length, making it more difficult to guess or steal a session ID.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:334:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,,::LANGUAGE NAME:Java:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"::Session ID's can be used to identify communicating parties in a web environment. The expected number of seconds required to guess a valid session identifier is given by the equation: (2^B+1)/(2*A*S) Where: - B is the number of bits of entropy in the session identifier. - A is the number of guesses an attacker can try each second. - S is the number of valid session identifiers that are valid and available to be guessed at any given time. The number of bits of entropy in the session identifier is always less than the total number of bits in the session identifier. For example, if session identifiers were provided in ascending order, there would be close to zero bits of entropy in the session identifier no matter the identifier's length. Assuming that the session identifiers are being generated using a good source of random numbers, we will estimate the number of bits of entropy in a session identifier to be half the total number of bits in the session identifier. For realistic identifier lengths this is possible, though perhaps optimistic.::",,::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.::PHASE:Implementation::,,,"::SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If an attacker can guess an authenticated user's session identifier, they can take over the user's session.::",,"::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Session identifiers should be at least 128 bits long to prevent brute-force session guessing. A shorter session identifier leaves the application open to brute-force session guessing attacks.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:A lower bound on the number of valid session identifiers that are available to be guessed is the number of users that are active on a site at any given moment. However, any users that abandon their sessions without logging out will increase this number. (This is one of many good reasons to have a short inactive session timeout.) With a 64 bit session identifier, assume 32 bits of entropy. For a large web site, assume that the attacker can try 1,000 guesses per second and that there are 10,000 valid session identifiers at any given moment. Given these assumptions, the expected time for an attacker to successfully guess a valid session identifier is less than 4 minutes. Now assume a 128 bit session identifier that provides 64 bits of entropy. With a very large web site, an attacker might try 10,000 guesses per second with 100,000 valid session identifiers available to be guessed. Given these assumptions, the expected time for an attacker to successfully guess a valid session identifier is greater than 292 years.::",,,,::TAXONOMY NAME:7 Pernicious Kingdoms:ENTRY NAME:J2EE Misconfiguration: Insufficient Session-ID Length::,::21::59::,

Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control. Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2022-2054:DESCRIPTION:Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2054::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-22204:DESCRIPTION:Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22204::REFERENCE:CVE-2021-22205:DESCRIPTION:Chain: backslash followed by a newline can bypass a validation step (CWE-20), leading to eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22205::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-5071:DESCRIPTION:Eval injection in PHP program.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-5071::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1750:DESCRIPTION:Eval injection in Perl program.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1750::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-5305:DESCRIPTION:Eval injection in Perl program using an ID that should only contain hyphens and numbers.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-5305::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1752:DESCRIPTION:Direct code injection into Perl eval function.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1752::REFERENCE:CVE-2002-1753:DESCRIPTION:Eval injection in Perl program.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1753::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1527:DESCRIPTION:Direct code injection into Perl eval function.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1527::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2837:DESCRIPTION:Direct code injection into Perl eval function.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2837::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-1921:DESCRIPTION:MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-1921::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-2498:DESCRIPTION:MFV. code injection into PHP eval statement using nested constructs that should not be nested.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2498::REFERENCE:CVE-2005-3302:DESCRIPTION:Code injection into Python eval statement from a field in a formatted file.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-3302::REFERENCE:CVE-2007-1253:DESCRIPTION:Eval injection in Python program.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1253::REFERENCE:CVE-2001-1471:DESCRIPTION:chain: Resultant eval injection.
