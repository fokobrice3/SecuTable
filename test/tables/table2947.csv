CVE-2020-1933,MEDIUM,A XSS vulnerability was found in Apache NiFi 1.0.0 to 1.10.0. Malicious scripts could be injected to the UI through action by an unaware authenticated user in Firefox. Did not appear to occur in other browsers.
CVE-2020-1934,MEDIUM,"In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41, mod_proxy_ftp may use uninitialized memory when proxying to a malicious FTP server."
CVE-2020-1935,MEDIUM,"In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely."
CVE-2020-1936,MEDIUM,A cross-site scripting issue was found in Apache Ambari Views. This was addressed in Apache Ambari 2.7.4.
CVE-2020-19360,MEDIUM,"Local file inclusion in FHEM 6.0 allows in fhem/FileLog_logWrapper file parameter can allow an attacker to include a file, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure."
CVE-2020-19361,MEDIUM,Reflected XSS in Medintux v2.16.000 CCAM.php by manipulating the mot1 parameter can result in an attacker performing malicious actions to users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page.
CVE-2020-19362,MEDIUM,Reflected XSS in Vtiger CRM v7.2.0 in vtigercrm/index.php? through the view parameter can result in an attacker performing malicious actions to users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page.
CVE-2020-19363,MEDIUM,"Vtiger CRM v7.2.0 allows an attacker to display hidden files, list directories by using /libraries and /layout directories."
CVE-2020-19364,MEDIUM,OpenEMR 5.0.1 allows an authenticated attacker to upload and execute malicious PHP scripts through /controller.php.
CVE-2020-1937,MEDIUM,"Kylin has some restful apis which will concatenate SQLs with the user input string, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries."
CVE-2020-1938,HIGH,"When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations."
