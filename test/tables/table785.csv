CVE-2020-6096,Candidate,"An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-4e92a61688   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SPYXTDOOB4PQGTYAMZAZNJIB3FF6YQXI/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-d860479b2a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/URXOIA2LDUKHQXK4BE55BQBRI6ZZG3Y6/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202101-20   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-20   |   MISC:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620   |   URL:https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620   |   MISC:https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019   |   URL:https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1019   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20221017 [SECURITY] [DLA 3152-1] glibc security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00021.html   |   MLIST:[mina-dev] 20210225 [jira] [Created] (FTPSERVER-500) Security vulnerability in common/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E",Assigned (20200107),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
