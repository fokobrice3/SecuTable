CVE-2000-0572,Razor,2007-02-22,Al Menendez,"Subsequent releases of Razor address this issue and utilize a more robust encryption mechanism for the Razor password. If you are under maintenance, you have the option of upgrading to a more recent release of Razor at no cost.  If you are not under maintenance and want to upgrade then you will need to contact Jennifer Stone at jstone@visible.com.

Some additional notes ...

- With version 4.1 and above, administrators of Razor may switch and use the local OS authentication instead of Razor’s authentication method.

- OS permissions and protections always apply to the artifacts stored in the database.

- This notice applies to users that have already logged into the supporting system.  This primary means of defense is intact inspite of this particular vulnerability.

- The next Razor release (due out in mid-2007) will allow remote UNIX clients to utilize SSH to authenticate the remote user.  More information on this release and others may be found on the Visible Systems web site:

CVE-2004-0230,Red Hat,2006-08-16,Mark J Cox,"The DHS advisory is a good source of background information about the
issue: http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA04-111A.html

It is important to note that the issue described is a known function of TCP. In order to perform a connection reset an attacker would need to know the source and destination ip address and ports as well as being able to guess the sequence number within the window. These requirements seriously reduce the ability to trigger a connection reset on normal TCP connections. The DHS advisory explains that BGP routing is a specific case where being able to trigger a reset is easier than expected as the end points can be easily determined and
large window sizes are used. BGP routing is also signficantly affected by having it’s connections terminated. The major BGP peers have recently switched to requiring md5 signatures which mitigates against this attack.

The following article from Linux Weekly News also puts the flaw into context and shows why it does not pose a significant threat:

This particular exploit is not particularly serious as no sensitive or private user information is ever held within cookies during our checkout process.  All user information and client information is secure in our platform.  We take all security threats quite seriously and view the efforts of the author of this particular exploit as harmful to our professional image.  This is especially important to note because the particular script vulnerability that has been raised poses no real threat to the stability or security of our systems.  Again, we are formally responding to this posted cross-site script vulnerability to communicate that we take all such potential security issues very seriously and this particular issue has been addressed.

In version 7.0.0 of our software, we have addressed the mentioned cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  On any page that a form is on, the query string is sanitized to eliminate the vectors outlined in the XSS vulnerability.  Form data is handled to protect against a form post from a different site to try and initialize a cross site scripting attacking via a form post. Sensitive data is not stored in session cookies and in the event that a cookie was stolen, it would contain nothing useful for the attacker.  Our software is a hosted application, which allows us to make quick remedies as new exploits are found.  Also, our system is monitored consistently and alerts are sent to our administrators when any malicious attempt is seen.   The details of this alert include the data sent, from what referral and if there is a specific user that is being targeted on our system."

CVE-2007-0120,Acunetix Limited,2007-01-31,Kevin J. Vella,"Information about HTTP Sniffer:
The HTTP Sniffer is an in-build proxy server in Acunetix WVS which purpose is to analyse web traffic between a web client (browser) and a web server. By default this tool is not enabled and when enabled it accepts traffic only from the same computer running Acunetix WVS (Localhost). The default TCP port used in 8080.

This means that when the HTTP Sniffer is enabled, it is only enabled on the local network interface and no one from the network can access the HTTP Sniffer port.

How the exploit works:
The exploit works by sending a specially crafted packet containing an invalid Content-Length field in the HTTP header to the TCP port on which the HTTP Sniffer is listening. This causes the application to crash (Denial of Service). Since the HTTP Sniffer component by default is enabled only on the local network interface, it is not possible to take advantage of this exploit remotely. The user has to manually change the listening interface from within the application’s configuration to make the HTTP Sniffer available on the network for this exploit to work remotely.

Solution:
Upgrade to the latest version of Acunetix WVS (v4.0 build 20060717 or later)"

CVE-2007-2997,ComCity LLC,2007-06-15,Michael Barber,"These tests preported to be discussed were reported falsely and were based upon an old unreleased flashy marketing created demonstration of the product and not using any &quot;officially&quot; released version of the software distributed to any customers.  This information was explained with the reporting party and they chose to ignore it.  ComCity has attempted to reproduce the reported issue using the SQL injection strings and a variety of other SQL injection strings and cannot reproduce the vulnerability on its currently released software.  In addition, the version of the software preported to be affected by this technique is no longer sold or even supported by ComCity and was discontinued nearly a year ago and replaced with a ASP.NET version.  However, we have attempted to reproduce this technique in this old, unsupported release of software that used ASP as well, and cannot reproduce it.
 
It is difficult to combat all combinations of SQL Injections through simple sanitation so ComCity discontinued these older ASP based products nearly a year ago.  ASP.NET is less susceptible to SQL Injection and we have informed our customers that the continued use of ASP in the current Internet security climate is unadvisable.  We advise all customers to upgrade to the latest products.  We welcome any report or finding that will help us improve or discover issues unknown to us.  However, the code in question does santize SQL injections and this entire report is inaccurate and was used in conjunction with an extortion request by a 3rd party company solicitating its services."

We have rated this as affecting Red Hat products with moderate security severity. Although the OpenSSL team have produced a patch for this issue, it is non-trivial and will require more testing before we can deploy it in a future update.  Our current plan is as follows:

- To include a backported fix in an OpenSSL update as part of Enterprise Linux 4.6. This will get testing via beta and give time for more extensive internal and upstream testing
- To release an update for OpenSSL for other platforms at the same time as 4.6 is released
