CVE-2004-2760,Candidate,"sshd in OpenSSH 3.5p1, when PermitRootLogin is disabled, immediately closes the TCP connection after a root login attempt with the correct password, but leaves the connection open after an attempt with an incorrect password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the password by observing the connection state, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.  NOTE: it could be argued that in most environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries without requiring leverage of a separate vulnerability.","BUGTRAQ:20040412 BID 7482, bug in OpenSSH (Still in FreeBSD-STABLE)   |   URL:http://archive.cert.uni-stuttgart.de/bugtraq/2004/04/msg00162.html   |   BUGTRAQ:20040413 Re: Fwd: [BID 7482, bug in OpenSSH (Still in FreeBSD-STABLE)]   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/360198   |   SREASON:4100   |   URL:http://securityreason.com/securityalert/4100",Assigned (20080803),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
