CVE-2021-37578,Candidate,"Apache jUDDI uses several classes related to Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) which (as an extension to UDDI) provides an alternate transport for accessing UDDI services. RMI uses the default Java serialization mechanism to pass parameters in RMI invocations. A remote attacker can send a malicious serialized object to the above RMI entries. The objects get deserialized without any check on the incoming data. In the worst case, it may let the attacker run arbitrary code remotely. For both jUDDI web service applications and jUDDI clients, the usage of RMI is disabled by default.

CVE-2021-37614,Candidate,"In certain Progress MOVEit Transfer versions before 2021.0.3 (aka 13.0.3), SQL injection in the MOVEit Transfer web application could allow an authenticated remote attacker to gain access to the database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database, or execute SQL statements that alter or delete database elements, via crafted strings sent to unique MOVEit Transfer transaction types. The fixed versions are 2019.0.7 (11.0.7), 2019.1.6 (11.1.6), 2019.2.3 (11.2.3), 2020.0.6 (12.0.6), 2020.1.5 (12.1.5), and 2021.0.3 (13.0.3).","CONFIRM:https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Vulnerability-August-2021   |   MISC:https://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/Transfer2019/ReleaseNotes/en/index.htm#48648.htm   |   MISC:https://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/Transfer2020/ReleaseNotes/en/index.htm#50951.htm   |   MISC:https://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/Transfer2021/ReleaseNotes/en/index.htm#link8",Assigned (20210729),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-37615,Candidate,"Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A null pointer dereference was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The null pointer dereference is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w   |   URL:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-399f869889   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMDT4PJB7P43WSOM3TRQIY3J33BAFVVE/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-cbaef8e2d5   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UYGDELIFFJWKUU7SO3QATCIXCZJERGAC/   |   MISC:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1758   |   URL:https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1758",Assigned (20210729),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
