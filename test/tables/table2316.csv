When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization.","BID:106566   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106566   |   CONFIRM:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=535669   |   URL:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=535669   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20181014-0001/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20181014-0001/   |   CONFIRM:https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbst03953en_us   |   URL:https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbst03953en_us   |   CONFIRM:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4278   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4278   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   MLIST:[activemq-issues] 20190820 [jira] [Created] (AMQ-7279) Security Vulnerabilities in Libraries - jackson-databind-2.9.8.jar, tomcat-servlet-api-8.0.53.jar, tomcat-websocket-api-8.0.53.jar, zookeeper-3.4.6.jar, guava-18.0.jar, jetty-all-9.2.26.v20180806.jar, scala-library-2.11.0.jar   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/053d9ce4d579b02203db18545fee5e33f35f2932885459b74d1e4272@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[bookkeeper-issues] 20200729 [GitHub] [bookkeeper] padma81 opened a new issue #2387: Security vulnerabilities in the apache/bookkeeper-4.9.2 image   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1b103833cb5bc8466e24ff0ecc5e75b45a705334ab6a444e64e840a0@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[druid-commits] 20191115 [GitHub] [incubator-druid] ccaominh opened a new pull request #8878: Address security vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9317fd092b257a0815434b116a8af8daea6e920b6673f4fd5583d5fe@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[druid-commits] 20210226 [GitHub] [druid] kingnj opened a new issue #10926: Hello, are there any plans to fix the CVE-2017-7657 and CVE-2017-7658 vulnerabilities of Jetty   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra6f956ed4ec2855583b2d0c8b4802b450f593d37b77509b48cd5d574@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[druid-commits] 20210304 [GitHub] [druid] suneet-s closed issue #10926: Hello, are there any plans to fix the CVE-2017-7657 and CVE-2017-7658 vulnerabilities of Jetty   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9159c9e7ec9eac1613da2dbaddbc15691a13d4dbb2c8be974f42e6ae@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[druid-commits] 20210304 [GitHub] [druid] suneet-s commented on issue #10926: Hello, are there any plans to fix the CVE-2017-7657 and CVE-2017-7658 vulnerabilities of Jetty   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41af10c4adec8d34a969abeb07fd0d6ad0c86768b751464f1cdd23e8@%3Ccommits.druid.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[lucene-solr-user] 20190104 Re: SOLR v7 Security Issues Caused Denial of Use - Sonatype Application Composition Report   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/708d94141126eac03011144a971a6411fcac16d9c248d1d535a39451@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E   |   SECTRACK:1041194   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041194",Assigned (20170411),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either ""HttpClientInterceptorPlugin"" or ""HttpClientBuilderPlugin"", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack.

CVE-2017-7692,Candidate,"SquirrelMail 1.4.22 (and other versions before 20170427_0200-SVN) allows post-authentication remote code execution via a sendmail.cf file that is mishandled in a popen call. It's possible to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server. The problem is in the Deliver_SendMail.class.php with the initStream function that uses escapeshellcmd() to sanitize the sendmail command before executing it. The use of escapeshellcmd() is not correct in this case since it doesn't escape whitespaces, allowing the injection of arbitrary command parameters. The problem is in -f$envelopefrom within the sendmail command line. Hence, if the target server uses sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it as a command-line program, it's possible to trick sendmail into using an attacker-provided configuration file that triggers the execution of an arbitrary command. For exploitation, the attacker must upload a sendmail.cf file as an email attachment, and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the -C option within the ""Options > Personal Informations > Email Address"" setting.","BID:98067   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98067   |   DEBIAN:DSA-3852   |   URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3852   |   EXPLOIT-DB:41910   |   URL:https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41910/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-201709-13   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-13   |   MISC:http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/04/19/6   |   MISC:http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/04/27/1   |   MISC:https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SquirrelMail-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2017-7692-Vuln.html   |   SECTRACK:1038312   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038312",Assigned (20170411),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
