See  |    http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html  |      |    Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail  |    list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether   |    application software should set its own limits, or rely  |    on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,  |    UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that  |    the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this  |    was refuted by others.  |      |    See the following threads at  |    http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html  |    ""Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)""  |    ""qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service""  |    ""[PATCH] denial of service""  |    ""just another qmail denial-of-service""  |    ""the UNIX way""  |    ""Time for a reality check""  |      |    Also see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that  |    is related to this topic:  |    BUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding  |    http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html  |    Baker> http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html  |    Berstein rejects this as a vulnerability, claiming this is a slander campaign by Wietse Venema.  |    His page states this is not a qmail problem, rather it is a UNIX problem  |    that many apps can consume all available memory, and that the administrator  |    is responsible to set limits in the OS, rather than expect applications to  |    individually prevent memory exhaustion.  CAN 1999-0250 does appear to  |    be a duplicate of this entry, based on the research I have done so far.  |    There were two different bugtraq postings, but the second one references  |    the first, stating that the new exploit uses perl instead of shell scripting  |    to accomplish the same attack/exploit.  |    Baker> http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/6970  |    http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/6969  |    http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html  |      |    Should probably reject CVE-1999-0250, and add these references to this  |    Candidate.  |    Baker> http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/2237  |    CHANGE> [Baker changed vote from REVIEWING to ACCEPT]  |    Christey> qmail-dos-1.c, as published by Wietse Venema (CVE-1999-0250)  |    in ""BUGTRAQ:19970612 Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)"", does not  |    use any RCPT commands.
