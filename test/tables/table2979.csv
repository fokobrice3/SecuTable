A successful exploit would allow an attacker to interact with the management interface with the privileges of the victim. However, as the attacker already needs admin privileges, there is no additional impact on the management interface itself."
CVE-2020-6779,HIGH,"Use of Hard-coded Credentials in the database of Bosch FSM-2500 server and Bosch FSM-5000 server up to and including version 5.2 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to log into the database with admin-privileges. This may result in complete compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the stored data as well as a high availability impact on the database itself. In addition, an attacker may execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system."
CVE-2020-6780,MEDIUM,Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort in the database of Bosch FSM-2500 server and Bosch FSM-5000 server up to and including version 5.2 allows a remote attacker with admin privileges to dump the credentials of other users and possibly recover their plain-text passwords by brute-forcing the MD5 hash.

CVE-2020-6793,MEDIUM,"When processing an email message with an ill-formed envelope, Thunderbird could read data from a random memory location. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5."
CVE-2020-6794,MEDIUM,"If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5."

CVE-2020-6798,MEDIUM,"If a template tag was used in a select tag, the parser could be confused and allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result. In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and Firefox < ESR68.5."
CVE-2020-6799,MEDIUM,"Command line arguments could have been injected during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for certain unsupported file types.
