CVE-2019-1858,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application to leak system memory, which could cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when processing inbound SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted SNMP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to leak system memory because of an improperly handled error condition during packet processing. Over time, this memory leak could cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.","BID:108358   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108358   |   CISCO:20190515 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Simple Network Management Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-snmp-dos",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

There are multiple race conditions during streaming stopping in this driver (part of the V4L2 subsystem). These issues are caused by wrong mutex locking in vivid_stop_generating_vid_cap(), vivid_stop_generating_vid_out(), sdr_cap_stop_streaming(), and the corresponding kthreads. At least one of these race conditions leads to a use-after-free.","BUGTRAQ:20200109 [slackware-security] Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2020-008-01)   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/10   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191205-0001/   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155890/Slackware-Security-Advisory-Slackware-14.2-kernel-Updates.html   |   MISC:https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191103221719.27118-1-alex.popov@linux.com/   |   MISC:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/11/02/1   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20200302 [SECURITY] [DLA 2114-1] linux-4.9 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/03/msg00001.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20191105 Re: [ Linux kernel ] Exploitable bugs in drivers/media/platform/vivid   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/11/05/1   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2675   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-12/msg00029.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4254-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4254-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4254-2   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4254-2/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4258-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4258-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4284-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4284-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4287-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4287-1/   |   UBUNTU:USN-4287-2   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4287-2/",Assigned (20191104),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-18684,Candidate,"** DISPUTED ** Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write ""ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL"" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers.","MISC:https://gist.github.com/oxagast/51171aa161074188a11d96cbef884bbd",Assigned (20191104),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2019-1869,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the internal packet-processing functionality of the Cisco StarOS operating system running on virtual platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service interface from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected interface. The device may have to be manually reloaded to recover from exploitation of this vulnerability.","BID:108853   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108853   |   CISCO:20190619 Cisco StarOS Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-staros-asr-dos",Assigned (20181206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
