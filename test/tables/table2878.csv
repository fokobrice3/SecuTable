By accessing a specific uniform resource locator on the web server, a remote attacker could be able to download a project file without prior authentication. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected system. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises the confidentiality of the targeted system."

An unauthorized user could exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the webserver. Specially crafted packets sent could cause a Denial-of-Service condition and if certain conditions are met, the affected devices must be restarted manually to fully recover. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
CVE-2019-13943,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability has been identified in EN100 Ethernet module DNP3 variant (All versions), EN100 Ethernet module IEC 61850 variant (All versions < V4.37), EN100 Ethernet module IEC104 variant (All versions), EN100 Ethernet module Modbus TCP variant (All versions), EN100 Ethernet module PROFINET IO variant (All versions). The web interface could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to modify content of particular web pages, causing the application to behave in unexpected ways for legitimate users. Successful exploitation does not require for an attacker to be authenticated to the web interface. This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents of the web application. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security. vulnerability was known."

CVE-2019-13946,HIGH,Profinet-IO (PNIO) stack versions prior V06.00 do not properly limit internal resource allocation when multiple legitimate diagnostic package requests are sent to the DCE-RPC interface. This could lead to a denial of service condition due to lack of memory for devices that include a vulnerable version of the stack. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to an affected device. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the availability of the device.
CVE-2019-13947,MEDIUM,A vulnerability has been identified in Control Center Server (CCS) (All versions < V1.5.0). The user configuration menu in the web interface of the Control Center Server (CCS) transfers user passwords in clear to the client (browser). An attacker with administrative privileges for the web interface could be able to read (and not only reset) passwords of other CCS users.
