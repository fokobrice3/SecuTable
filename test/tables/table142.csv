1334,"Unauthorized Error Injection Can Degrade Hardware Redundancy",Base,Draft,"An unauthorized agent can inject errors into a redundant block to deprive the system of redundancy or put the system in a degraded operating mode.","To ensure the performance and functional reliability of certain components, hardware designers can implement hardware blocks for redundancy in the case that others fail. This redundant block can be prevented from performing as intended if the design allows unauthorized agents to inject errors into it. In this way, a path with injected errors may become unavailable to serve as a redundant channel. This may put the system into a degraded mode of operation which could be exploited by a subsequent attack.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture and design and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during implementation and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::PHASE:Integration:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during integration and identified later during Testing or System Configuration phases.::","",,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:IMPACT:DoS: Instability:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Reduce Performance:IMPACT:Reduce Reliability:IMPACT:Unexpected State::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Ensure the design does not allow error injection in modes intended for normal run-time operation.

1338,"Improper Protections Against Hardware Overheating",Base,Draft,"A hardware device is missing or has inadequate protection features to prevent overheating.","Hardware, electrical circuits, and semiconductor silicon have thermal side effects, such that some of the energy consumed by the device gets dissipated as heat and increases the temperature of the device. For example, in semiconductors, higher-operating frequency of silicon results in higher power dissipation and heat. The leakage current in CMOS circuits increases with temperature, and this creates positive feedback that can result in thermal runaway and damage the device permanently. Any device lacking protections such as thermal sensors, adequate platform cooling, or thermal insulation is susceptible to attacks by malicious software that might deliberately operate the device in modes that result in overheating. This can be used as an effective denial of service (DoS) or permanent denial of service (PDoS) attack. Depending on the type of hardware device and its expected usage, such thermal overheating can also cause safety hazards and reliability issues. Note that battery failures can also cause device overheating but the mitigations and examples included in this submission cannot reliably protect against a battery failure. There can be similar weaknesses with lack of protection from attacks based on overvoltage or overcurrent conditions. However, thermal heat is generated by hardware operation and the device should implement protection from overheating.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:693:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Power Management Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Processor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Such issues could be introduced during hardware architecture, design or implementation.::","",,"::SCOPE:Availability:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):LIKELIHOOD:High::","::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:DESCRIPTION:Dynamic tests should be performed to stress-test temperature controls.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:Power management controls should be part of Architecture and Design reviews.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Temperature maximum and minimum limits should be enforced using thermal sensors both in silicon and at the platform level.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:The platform should support cooling solutions such as fans that can be modulated based on device-operation needs to maintain a stable temperature.::","",,,"",::624::625::,"",
1342,"Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution",Base,Incomplete,"The processor does not properly clear microarchitectural state after incorrect microcode assists or speculative execution, resulting in transient execution.","In many processor architectures an exception, mis-speculation, or microcode assist results in a flush operation to clear results that are no longer required. This action prevents these results from influencing architectural state that is intended to be visible from software. However, traces of this transient execution may remain in microarchitectural buffers, resulting in a change in microarchitectural state that can expose sensitive information to an attacker using side-channel analysis. For example, Load Value Injection (LVI) [REF-1202] can exploit direct injection of erroneous values into intermediate load and store buffers. Several conditions may need to be fulfilled for a successful attack: 1) incorrect transient execution that results in remanence of sensitive information; 2) attacker has the ability to provoke microarchitectural exceptions; 3) operations and structures in victim code that can be exploited must be identified.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:226:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:226:VIEW ID:1194:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Workstation:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:x86:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:ARM:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:Other:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Requirements::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:LIKELIHOOD:Medium::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Hardware ensures that no illegal data flows from faulting micro-ops exists at the microarchitectural level.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Build and Compilation:DESCRIPTION:Include instructions that explicitly remove traces of unneeded computations from software interactions with microarchitectural elements e.g. lfence, sfence, mfence, clflush.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-0551:DESCRIPTION:Load value injection in some processors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to enable information disclosure via a side-channel with local access.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-0551::",,,"",::696::,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:CWE-1342 differs from CWE-1303, which is related to misprediction and biasing microarchitectural components, while CWE-1342 addresses illegal data flows and retention.

1351,"Improper Handling of Hardware Behavior in Exceptionally Cold Environments",Base,Incomplete,"A hardware device, or the firmware running on it, is missing or has incorrect protection features to maintain goals of security primitives when the device is cooled below standard operating temperatures.","The hardware designer may improperly anticipate hardware behavior when exposed to exceptionally cold conditions. As a result they may introduce a weakness by not accounting for the modified behavior of critical components when in extreme environments. An example of a change in behavior is that power loss won't clear/reset any volatile state when cooled below standard operating temperatures. This may result in a weakness when the starting state of the volatile memory is being relied upon for a security decision. For example, a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) may be supplied as a security primitive to improve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees. However, when the PUF is paired with DRAM, SRAM, or another temperature sensitive entropy source, the system designer may introduce weakness by failing to account for the chosen entropy source's behavior at exceptionally low temperatures. In the case of DRAM and SRAM, when power is cycled at low temperatures, the device will not contain the bitwise biasing caused by inconsistencies in manufacturing and will instead contain the data from previous boot. Should the PUF primitive be used in a cryptographic construction which does not account for full adversary control of PUF seed data, weakness would arise. This weakness does not cover Cold Boot Attacks wherein RAM or other external storage is super cooled and read externally by an attacker.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1384:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Not Language-Specific:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:Not OS-Specific:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Embedded:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Microcomputer:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Authentication:IMPACT:Varies by Context:IMPACT:Unexpected State:LIKELIHOOD:Low:NOTE:Consequences of this weakness are highly contextual.::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:The system should account for security primitive behavior when cooled outside standard temperatures.::","",,,"",::624::625::,"",
1357,"Reliance on Insufficiently Trustworthy Component",Class,Incomplete,"The product is built from multiple separate components, but it uses a component that is not sufficiently trusted to meet expectations for security, reliability, updateability, and maintainability.","Many modern hardware and software products are built by combining multiple smaller components together into one larger entity, often during the design or architecture phase. For example, a hardware component might be built by a separate supplier, or the product might use an open-source software library from a third party. Regardless of the source, each component should be sufficiently trusted to ensure correct, secure operation of the product. If a component is not trustworthy, it can produce significant risks for the overall product, such as vulnerabilities that cannot be patched fast enough (if at all); hidden functionality such as malware; inability to update or replace the component if needed for security purposes; hardware components built from parts that do not meet specifications in ways that can lead to weaknesses; etc. Note that a component might not be trustworthy even if it is owned by the product vendor, such as a software component whose source code is lost and was built by developers who left the company, or a component that was developed by a separate company that was acquired and brought into the product's own company. Note that there can be disagreement as to whether a component is sufficiently trustworthy, since trust is ultimately subjective. Different stakeholders (e.g., customers, vendors, governments) have various threat models and ways to assess trust, and design/architecture choices might make tradeoffs between security, reliability, safety, privacy, cost, and other characteristics.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:710:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"::ORDINALITY:Indirect::",::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Not Architecture-Specific:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Not Technology-Specific:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:ICS/OT:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Requirements:NOTE:Requirements might include criteria for which the only available solutions are provided by insufficiently trusted components.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:An insufficiently trusted component might be selected because it is less expensive to do in-house, requires expertise that is not available in-house, or might allow the product to reach the market faster.::","",,"::SCOPE:Other:IMPACT:Reduce Maintainability::","","::PHASE:Requirements Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:For each component, ensure that its supply chain is well-controlled with sub-tier suppliers using best practices.
