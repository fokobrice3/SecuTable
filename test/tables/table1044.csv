CVE-2021-41194,Candidate,"FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3   |   URL:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3   |   MISC:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38   |   URL:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38   |   MISC:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch   |   URL:https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41253,Candidate,"Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/security/advisories/GHSA-q42v-hv86-3m4g   |   URL:https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/security/advisories/GHSA-q42v-hv86-3m4g   |   MISC:https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/commit/55dd08c210722aed81b38132f5fd4a04ec1943b5   |   URL:https://github.com/zyantific/zydis/commit/55dd08c210722aed81b38132f5fd4a04ec1943b5   |   MISC:https://huntr.dev/bounties/96b0a482-7041-45b1-9327-c6a4a8f32d3a   |   URL:https://huntr.dev/bounties/96b0a482-7041-45b1-9327-c6a4a8f32d3a   |   MISC:https://huntr.dev/bounties/d2536d7d-36ce-4723-928c-98d1ee039784   |   URL:https://huntr.dev/bounties/d2536d7d-36ce-4723-928c-98d1ee039784",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41270,Candidate,"Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions 4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1, maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the `CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` with a tab `\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab (0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char (Tab `\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions 4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to cells starting by `\t`, `\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-2xhg-w2g5-w95x   |   URL:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-2xhg-w2g5-w95x   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-0294e8ca24   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QSREFD2TJT5LWKM6S4MD3W26NQQ5WJUP/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-10fd47b32d   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3BPT4SF6SIXFMZARDWED5T32J7JEH3EP/   |   MISC:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/3da6f2d45e7536ccb2a26f52fbaf340917e208a8   |   URL:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/3da6f2d45e7536ccb2a26f52fbaf340917e208a8   |   MISC:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/44243   |   URL:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/44243   |   MISC:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/releases/tag/v5.3.12   |   URL:https://github.com/symfony/symfony/releases/tag/v5.3.12",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41272,Candidate,"Besu is an Ethereum client written in Java. Starting in version 21.10.0, changes in the implementation of the SHL, SHR, and SAR operations resulted in the introduction of a signed type coercion error in values that represent negative values for 32 bit signed integers. Smart contracts that ask for shifts between approximately 2 billion and 4 billion bits (nonsensical but valid values for the operation) will fail to execute and hence fail to validate. In networks where vulnerable versions are mining with other clients or non-vulnerable versions this will result in a fork and the relevant transactions will not be included in the fork. In networks where vulnerable versions are not mining (such as Rinkeby) no fork will result and the validator nodes will stop accepting blocks.
