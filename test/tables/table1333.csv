While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data.

Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7, 1.1.2 and 1.2.0.

CVE-2022-41903,Candidate,"Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers.

When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7.

CVE-2022-41923,Candidate,"Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed.

Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-q2hm-2h45-v5g3   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-q2hm-2h45-v5g3   |   MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/443e8398b75a1295067d74afb5898370782d863a#diff-f8a8f8ba80dfc55f044e2e60b521ce379176430ca6921b0f87b79cf682531f79L322   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/443e8398b75a1295067d74afb5898370782d863a#diff-f8a8f8ba80dfc55f044e2e60b521ce379176430ca6921b0f87b79cf682531f79L322   |   MISC:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm   |   URL:https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm   |   MISC:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19869   |   URL:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19869   |   MISC:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19945   |   URL:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19945",Assigned (20220930),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-41952,Candidate,"Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance, Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream URL is, for example, posted to a large room with many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after 30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not supported and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a workaround, turn off URL preview functionality by setting `url_preview_enabled: false` in the Synapse configuration file.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4822-jvwx-w47h   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4822-jvwx-w47h   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11784   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11784   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11936   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11936   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.52.0   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.52.0   |   MISC:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0   |   URL:https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0",Assigned (20220930),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2022-41953,Candidate,"Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for Windows. Its target audience is users who are uncomfortable with using Git on the command-line. Git GUI has a function to clone repositories. Immediately after the local clone is available, Git GUI will automatically post-process it, among other things running a spell checker called `aspell.exe` if it was found. Git GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk script. Due to the unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for an executable _always includes the current directory_. Therefore, malicious repositories can ship with an `aspell.exe` in their top-level directory which is executed by Git GUI without giving the user a chance to inspect it first, i.e. running untrusted code. This issue has been addressed in version 2.39.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using Git GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, at least avoid cloning from untrusted sources.","MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/7360767e8dfc1895a932324079f7d45d7791d39f   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/7360767e8dfc1895a932324079f7d45d7791d39f   |   MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/4219   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/4219   |   MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v4px-mx59-w99c   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-v4px-mx59-w99c   |   MISC:https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/exec.html#M23   |   URL:https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/exec.html#M23",Assigned (20220930),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2022-41954,Candidate,"MPXJ is an open source library to read and write project plans from a variety of file formats and databases. On Unix-like operating systems (not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of `File.createTempFile(..)` results in temporary files being created with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a schedule file which requires the creation of a temporary file or directory, a knowledgeable local user could locate these transient files while they are in use and would then be able to read the schedule being processed by MPXJ. The problem has been patched, MPXJ version 10.14.1 and later includes the necessary changes. Users unable to upgrade may set `java.io.tmpdir` to a directory to which only the user running the application has access will prevent other users from accessing these temporary files.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/joniles/mpxj/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2p-4gqj-849g   |   URL:https://github.com/joniles/mpxj/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2p-4gqj-849g   |   MISC:https://github.com/joniles/mpxj/commit/287ad0234213c52b0638565e14bd9cf3ed44cedd   |   URL:https://github.com/joniles/mpxj/commit/287ad0234213c52b0638565e14bd9cf3ed44cedd",Assigned (20220930),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
