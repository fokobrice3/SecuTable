CWE-ID,Name,Weakness Abstraction,Status,Description
200,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,Class,Draft,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
250,Execution with Unnecessary Privileges,Base,Draft,The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.
295,Improper Certificate Validation,Base,Draft,The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.
297,Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch,Variant,Incomplete,The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.
312,Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
319,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
359,Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor,Base,Incomplete,The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.
362,Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),Class,Draft,The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.
511,Logic/Time Bomb,Base,Incomplete,The product contains code that is designed to disrupt the legitimate operation of the product (or its environment) when a certain time passes, or when a certain logical condition is met.
602,Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security,Class,Draft,The product is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server.
672,Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release,Class,Draft,The product uses, accesses, or otherwise operates on a resource after that resource has been expired, released, or revoked.
772,Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime,Base,Draft,The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.
798,Use of Hard-coded Credentials,Base,Draft,The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.
920,Improper Restriction of Power Consumption,Base,Incomplete,The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be automatically replenished, but the product does not properly restrict the amount of power that its operation consumes.
921,Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control,Base,Incomplete,The product stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have built-in access control.
925,Improper Verification of Intent by Broadcast Receiver,Variant,Incomplete,The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source.
926,Improper Export of Android Application Components,Variant,Incomplete,The Android application exports a component for use by other applications, but does not properly restrict which applications can launch the component or access the data it contains.
927,Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication,Variant,Incomplete,The Android application uses an implicit intent for transmitting sensitive data to other applications.
939,Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.
940,Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,The product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor, but it does not properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.
941,Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.
