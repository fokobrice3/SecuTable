CVE-2023-22736,Candidate,"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions starting with 2.5.0-rc1 and above, prior to 2.5.8, and version 2.6.0-rc4, are vulnerable to an authorization bypass bug which allows a malicious Argo CD user to deploy Applications outside the configured allowed namespaces. Reconciled Application namespaces are specified as a comma-delimited list of glob patterns. When sharding is enabled on the Application controller, it does not enforce that list of patterns when reconciling Applications. For example, if Application namespaces are configured to be argocd-*, the Application controller may reconcile an Application installed in a namespace called other, even though it does not start with argocd-. Reconciliation of the out-of-bounds Application is only triggered when the Application is updated, so the attacker must be able to cause an update operation on the Application resource. This bug only applies to users who have explicitly enabled the ""apps-in-any-namespace"" feature by setting `application.namespaces` in the argocd-cmd-params-cm ConfigMap or otherwise setting the `--application-namespaces` flags on the Application controller and API server components. The apps-in-any-namespace feature is in beta as of this Security Advisory's publish date. The bug is also limited to Argo CD instances where sharding is enabled by increasing the `replicas` count for the Application controller. Finally, the AppProjects' `sourceNamespaces` field acts as a secondary check against this exploit. To cause reconciliation of an Application in an out-of-bounds namespace, an AppProject must be available which permits Applications in the out-of-bounds namespace. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.5.8 and 2.6.0-rc5. As a workaround, running only one replica of the Application controller will prevent exploitation of this bug. Making sure all AppProjects' sourceNamespaces are restricted within the confines of the configured Application namespaces will also prevent exploitation of this bug.","MISC:https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6p4m-hw2h-6gmw   |   URL:https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6p4m-hw2h-6gmw",Assigned (20230106),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-22743,Candidate,"Git for Windows is the Windows port of the revision control system Git. Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-loading said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation. Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer, or move the installer into a different directory before executing it.","MISC:https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/   |   URL:https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/   |   MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.39.2.windows.1   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.39.2.windows.1   |   MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3   |   MISC:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq   |   URL:https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq   |   MISC:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/cookbook-overview?redirectedfrom=MSDN#using-comctl32dll-version-6-in-an-application-that-uses-only-standard-extensions   |   URL:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/cookbook-overview?redirectedfrom=MSDN#using-comctl32dll-version-6-in-an-application-that-uses-only-standard-extensions   |   MISC:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/about-side-by-side-assemblies-   |   URL:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/about-side-by-side-assemblies-",Assigned (20230106),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-22745,Candidate,"tpm2-tss is an open source software implementation of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2 Software Stack (TSS2). In affected versions `Tss2_RC_SetHandler` and `Tss2_RC_Decode` both index into `layer_handler` with an 8 bit layer number, but the array only has `TPM2_ERROR_TSS2_RC_LAYER_COUNT` entries, so trying to add a handler for higher-numbered layers or decode a response code with such a layer number reads/writes past the end of the buffer. This Buffer overrun, could result in arbitrary code execution. An example attack would be a MiTM bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFF for the RC. Given the common use case of TPM modules an attacker must have local access to the target machine with local system privileges which allows access to the TPM system. Usually TPM access requires administrative privilege.","MISC:https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/commit/306490c8d848c367faa2d9df81f5e69dab46ffb5   |   URL:https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/commit/306490c8d848c367faa2d9df81f5e69dab46ffb5   |   MISC:https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/security/advisories/GHSA-4j3v-fh23-vx67   |   URL:https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/security/advisories/GHSA-4j3v-fh23-vx67",Assigned (20230106),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
