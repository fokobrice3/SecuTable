CVE-2023-24813,Candidate,"Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols. Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects `xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which is later used to parse the svg file, parses the href attribute. Since `href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified, it's possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution, depending on available classes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version 2.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2023-24814,Candidate,"TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework released under the GNU General Public License. In affected versions the TYPO3 core component `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` uses the unfiltered server environment variable `PATH_INFO`, which allows attackers to inject malicious content. In combination with the TypoScript setting `config.absRefPrefix=auto`, attackers can inject malicious HTML code to pages that have not been rendered and cached, yet. As a result, injected values would be cached and delivered to other website visitors (persisted cross-site scripting). Individual code which relies on the resolved value of `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('SCRIPT_NAME')` and corresponding usages (as shown below) are vulnerable as well. Additional investigations confirmed that at least Apache web server deployments using CGI (FPM, FCGI/FastCGI, and similar) are affected. However, there still might be the risk that other scenarios like nginx, IIS, or Apache/mod_php are vulnerable. The usage of server environment variable `PATH_INFO` has been removed from corresponding processings in `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()`. Besides that, the public property `TypoScriptFrontendController::$absRefPrefix` is encoded for both being used as a URI component and for being used as a prefix in an HTML context. This mitigates the cross-site scripting vulnerability. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.51 ELTS, 9.5.40 ELTS, 10.4.35 LTS, 11.5.23 LTS and 12.2.0 which fix this problem. For users who are unable to patch in a timely manner the TypoScript setting `config.absRefPrefix` should at least be set to a static path value, instead of using auto - e.g. `config.absRefPrefix=/`. This workaround **does not fix all aspects of the vulnerability**, and is just considered to be an intermediate mitigation to the most prominent manifestation.","MISC:https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix   |   URL:https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/GeneralUtility.php#L2481-L2484   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/core/Classes/Utility/GeneralUtility.php#L2481-L2484   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Controller/TypoScriptFrontendController.php#L2547-L2549   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/blob/v11.5.22/typo3/sysext/frontend/Classes/Controller/TypoScriptFrontendController.php#L2547-L2549   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/0005a6fd86ab97eff8bf2e3a5828bf0e7cb6263a   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/0005a6fd86ab97eff8bf2e3a5828bf0e7cb6263a   |   MISC:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-r4f8-f93x-5qh3   |   URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-r4f8-f93x-5qh3   |   MISC:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-001   |   URL:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-001   |   MISC:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2023-001   |   URL:https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2023-001",Assigned (20230130),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2023-24815,Candidate,"Vert.x-Web is a set of building blocks for building web applications in the java programming language. When running vertx web applications that serve files using `StaticHandler` on Windows Operating Systems and Windows File Systems, if the mount point is a wildcard (`*`) then an attacker can exfiltrate any class path resource. When computing the relative path to locate the resource, in case of wildcards, the code: `return ""/"" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns the user input (without validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized `\` are not properly handled and an attacker can build a path that is valid within the classpath. This issue only affects users deploying in windows environments and upgrading is the advised remediation path.
