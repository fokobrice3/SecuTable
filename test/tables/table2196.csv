CVE-2017-12244,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of IPv6 packets for Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization or to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Snort process restarts unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the fields in the IPv6 extension header packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv6 packet to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic only. This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software Releases 6.0 and later when the software has one or more file action policies configured and is running on any of the following Cisco products: 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISR), Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 7000 Series Appliances, Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 8000 Series Appliances, FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances, FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances, Firepower Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs), Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances, Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances, Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances, Virtual Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) for VMware.
