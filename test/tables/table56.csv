Name,Weakness Abstraction,Status,Description,Extended Description
External Control of System or Configuration Setting,Base,Incomplete,One or more system settings or configuration elements can be externally controlled by a user.,"Allowing external control of system settings can disrupt service or cause an application to behave in unexpected, and potentially malicious ways."
Relative Path Traversal,Base,Draft,"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as .. that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.",This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.
Absolute Path Traversal,Base,Draft,"The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as /abs/path that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.",This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.
Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence,Base,Incomplete,The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.,"Path equivalence is usually employed in order to circumvent access controls expressed using an incomplete set of file name or file path representations. This is different from path traversal, wherein the manipulations are performed to generate a name for a different object."
Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'),Base,Draft,"The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.",
Improper Handling of File Names that Identify Virtual Resources,Base,Draft,"The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a file name that identifies a virtual resource that is not directly specified within the directory that is associated with the file name, causing the product to perform file-based operations on a resource that is not a file.","Virtual file names are represented like normal file names, but they are effectively aliases for other resources that do not behave like normal files. Depending on their functionality, they could be alternate entities. They are not necessarily listed in directories."
External Control of File Name or Path,Base,Draft,The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.,"This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application. Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met: 1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem. 2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted. For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker."
Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements,Base,Draft,"The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes equivalent special elements.","The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a dangerous -e command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for --exec or other switches that have the same semantics."
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'),Base,Stable,"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.","This could allow attackers to execute unexpected, dangerous commands directly on the operating system. This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage. There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection: The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(nslookup [HOSTNAME]) to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing. The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use exec([COMMAND]) to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line. From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input."
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),Base,Stable,The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.,"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when: Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain. There are three main kinds of XSS: Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser. Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as drive-by hacking. In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious."
Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection'),Base,Draft,"The product constructs a string for a command to executed by a separate component in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.","When creating commands using interpolation into a string, developers may assume that only the arguments/options that they specify will be processed. This assumption may be even stronger when the programmer has encoded the command in a way that prevents separate commands from being provided maliciously, e.g. in the case of shell metacharacters. When constructing the command, the developer may use whitespace or other delimiters that are required to separate arguments when the command. However, if an attacker can provide an untrusted input that contains argument-separating delimiters, then the resulting command will have more arguments than intended by the developer. The attacker may then be able to change the behavior of the command. Depending on the functionality supported by the extraneous arguments, this may have security-relevant consequences."
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),Base,Stable,"The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.","Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data. This can be used to alter query logic to bypass security checks, or to insert additional statements that modify the back-end database, possibly including execution of system commands. SQL injection has become a common issue with database-driven web sites. The flaw is easily detected, and easily exploited, and as such, any site or product package with even a minimal user base is likely to be subject to an attempted attack of this kind. This flaw depends on the fact that SQL makes no real distinction between the control and data planes."
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'),Base,Draft,"The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.",
XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection),Base,Draft,"The product does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system.","Within XML, special elements could include reserved words or characters such as <, >, , and &, which could then be used to add new data or modify XML syntax."
Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection'),Base,Draft,"The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.",
Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),Base,Draft,"The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.","When a product allows a user's input to contain code syntax, it might be possible for an attacker to craft the code in such a way that it will alter the intended control flow of the product. Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities."
Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection'),Base,Draft,"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.",
Missing XML Validation,Base,Draft,The product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema.,"Most successful attacks begin with a violation of the programmer's assumptions. By accepting an XML document without validating it against a DTD or XML schema, the programmer leaves a door open for attackers to provide unexpected, unreasonable, or malicious input."
Misinterpretation of Input,Base,Incomplete,"The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a security-relevant fashion.",
Improper Output Neutralization for Logs,Base,Draft,The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.,This can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs. Log forging vulnerabilities occur when: Data enters an application from an untrusted source. The data is written to an application or system log file.
Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'),Base,Incomplete,"The product copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.","A buffer overflow condition exists when a product attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold, or when it attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the classic case in which the product copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist, but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections."
Write-what-where Condition,Base,Draft,"Any condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.",
Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow'),Base,Incomplete,The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.,"This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used."
Out-of-bounds Read,Base,Draft,"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","Typically, this can allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash. A crash can occur when the code reads a variable amount of data and assumes that a sentinel exists to stop the read operation, such as a NUL in a string. The expected sentinel might not be located in the out-of-bounds memory, causing excessive data to be read, leading to a segmentation fault or a buffer overflow. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent read operation then produces undefined or unexpected results."
Wrap-around Error,Base,Incomplete,"Wrap around errors occur whenever a value is incremented past the maximum value for its type and therefore wraps around to a very small, negative, or undefined value.",
Improper Validation of Array Index,Variant,Draft,"The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.",
Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency,Base,Incomplete,"The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.","If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected, and possibly, malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code."
Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size,Base,Draft,"The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.",
Use of Externally-Controlled Format String,Base,Draft,"The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.","When an attacker can modify an externally-controlled format string, this can lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or data representation problems. It should be noted that in some circumstances, such as internationalization, the set of format strings is externally controlled by design. If the source of these format strings is trusted (e.g. only contained in library files that are only modifiable by the system administrator), then the external control might not itself pose a vulnerability."
Incorrect Calculation of Multi-Byte String Length,Base,Draft,The product does not correctly calculate the length of strings that can contain wide or multi-byte characters.,
Improper Neutralization of Delimiters,Base,Draft,The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes delimiters.,
Improper Handling of Missing Special Element,Base,Draft,"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles when an expected special element is missing.",
Improper Handling of Additional Special Element,Base,Draft,"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles when an additional unexpected special element is provided.",
Improper Handling of Inconsistent Special Elements,Base,Draft,The product does not properly handle input in which an inconsistency exists between two or more special characters or reserved words.,"An example of this problem would be if paired characters appear in the wrong order, or if the special characters are not properly nested."
Improper Null Termination,Base,Incomplete,The product does not terminate or incorrectly terminates a string or array with a null character or equivalent terminator.,"Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible."
Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.","Improperly handled case sensitive data can lead to several possible consequences, including: case-insensitive passwords reducing the size of the key space, making brute force attacks easier bypassing filters or access controls using alternate names multiple interpretation errors using alternate names."
Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation,Base,Incomplete,"The product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.","Product needs to validate data at the proper time, after data has been canonicalized and cleansed. Early validation is susceptible to various manipulations that result in dangerous inputs that are produced by canonicalization and cleansing."
Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value,Base,Draft,The product filters data in a way that causes it to be reduced or collapsed into an unsafe value that violates an expected security property.,
Permissive List of Allowed Inputs,Base,Draft,"The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.",
Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs,Base,Draft,"The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete, leading to resultant weaknesses.","Developers often try to protect their products against malicious input by performing tests against inputs that are known to be bad, such as special characters that can invoke new commands. However, such lists often only account for the most well-known bad inputs. Attackers may be able to find other malicious inputs that were not expected by the developer, allowing them to bypass the intended protection mechanism."
Overly Restrictive Regular Expression,Base,Draft,"A regular expression is overly restrictive, which prevents dangerous values from being detected.","This weakness is not about regular expression complexity. Rather, it is about a regular expression that does not match all values that are intended. Consider the use of a regexp to identify acceptable values or to spot unwanted terms. An overly restrictive regexp misses some potentially security-relevant values leading to either false positives *or* false negatives, depending on how the regexp is being used within the code. Consider the expression /[0-8]/ where the intention was /[0-9]/. This expression is not complex but the value 9 is not matched when maybe the programmer planned to check for it."
Reliance on Data/Memory Layout,Base,Draft,"The product makes invalid assumptions about how protocol data or memory is organized at a lower level, resulting in unintended program behavior.","When changing platforms or protocol versions, in-memory organization of data may change in unintended ways. For example, some architectures may place local variables A and B right next to each other with A on top; some may place them next to each other with B on top; and others may add some padding to each. The padding size may vary to ensure that each variable is aligned to a proper word size. In protocol implementations, it is common to calculate an offset relative to another field to pick out a specific piece of data. Exceptional conditions, often involving new protocol versions, may add corner cases that change the data layout in an unusual way. The result can be that an implementation accesses an unintended field in the packet, treating data of one type as data of another type."
Integer Overflow or Wraparound,Base,Stable,"The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.","An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number. While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on wrapping, it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs. This becomes security-critical when the result is used to control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc."
Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound),Base,Draft,"The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.",This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.
Integer Coercion Error,Variant,Incomplete,"Integer coercion refers to a set of flaws pertaining to the type casting, extension, or truncation of primitive data types.","Several flaws fall under the category of integer coercion errors. For the most part, these errors in and of themselves result only in availability and data integrity issues. However, in some circumstances, they may result in other, more complicated security related flaws, such as buffer overflow conditions."
Off-by-one Error,Base,Draft,"A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.",
Numeric Truncation Error,Base,Incomplete,Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.,"When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred."
Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering,Base,Draft,"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not account for byte ordering (e.g. big-endian and little-endian) when processing the input, causing an incorrect number or value to be used.",
Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data,Base,Draft,"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.","Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure)."
Observable Response Discrepancy,Base,Incomplete,The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.,"This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design)."
Observable Behavioral Discrepancy,Base,Incomplete,"The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or (2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.","Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by attackers to form a side channel."
Observable Timing Discrepancy,Base,Incomplete,"Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.","In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel."
Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,"The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.","The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways: self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of .. sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query."
Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer,Base,Incomplete,"The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.","Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing. For example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site."
Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies,Base,Draft,"The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.","When handling information, the developer must consider whether the information is regarded as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators. Each stakeholder effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold. When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users."
Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information,Base,Incomplete,"A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.","Many operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related resources."
Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code,Base,Draft,"The product inserts sensitive information into debugging code, which could expose this information if the debugging code is not disabled in production.","When debugging, it may be necessary to report detailed information to the programmer. However, if the debugging code is not disabled when the product is operating in a production environment, then this sensitive information may be exposed to attackers."
Truncation of Security-relevant Information,Base,Draft,"The product truncates the display, recording, or processing of security-relevant information in a way that can obscure the source or nature of an attack.",
Omission of Security-relevant Information,Base,Draft,"The product does not record or display information that would be important for identifying the source or nature of an attack, or determining if an action is safe.",
Obscured Security-relevant Information by Alternate Name,Base,Incomplete,"The product records security-relevant information according to an alternate name of the affected entity, instead of the canonical name.",
Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse,Base,Draft,"The product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or zeroize the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.","When resources are released, they can be made available for reuse. For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information. Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated. This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels."
Improper Handling of Values,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not properly handle when the expected number of values for parameters, fields, or arguments is not provided in input, or if those values are undefined.",
Improper Handling of Parameters,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not properly handle when the expected number of parameters, fields, or arguments is not provided in input, or if those parameters are undefined.",
Improper Handling of Structural Elements,Base,Incomplete,The product does not handle or incorrectly handles inputs that are related to complex structures.,
Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type,Base,Draft,"The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when a particular element is not the expected type, e.g. it expects a digit (0-9) but is provided with a letter (A-Z).",
Use of Inherently Dangerous Function,Base,Draft,The product calls a function that can never be guaranteed to work safely.,"Certain functions behave in dangerous ways regardless of how they are used. Functions in this category were often implemented without taking security concerns into account. The gets() function is unsafe because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized input to gets() and overflow the destination buffer. Similarly, the >> operator is unsafe to use when reading into a statically-allocated character array because it does not perform bounds checking on the size of its input. An attacker can easily send arbitrarily-sized input to the >> operator and overflow the destination buffer."
Creation of chroot Jail Without Changing Working Directory,Variant,Draft,"The product uses the chroot() system call to create a jail, but does not change the working directory afterward. This does not prevent access to files outside of the jail.","Improper use of chroot() may allow attackers to escape from the chroot jail. The chroot() function call does not change the process's current working directory, so relative paths may still refer to file system resources outside of the chroot jail after chroot() has been called."
Uncaught Exception,Base,Draft,"An exception is thrown from a function, but it is not caught.","When an exception is not caught, it may cause the program to crash or expose sensitive information."
Execution with Unnecessary Privileges,Base,Draft,"The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.","New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges. Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges."
Unchecked Return Value,Base,Draft,"The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.","Two common programmer assumptions are this function call can never fail and it doesn't matter if this function call fails. If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected, then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability, because the product is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example, if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped, then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges."
Incorrect Check of Function Return Value,Base,Incomplete,"The product incorrectly checks a return value from a function, which prevents it from detecting errors or exceptional conditions.",Important and common functions will return some value about the success of its actions. This will alert the program whether or not to handle any errors caused by that function.
Plaintext Storage of a Password,Base,Incomplete,Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.,"Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used."
Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format,Base,Incomplete,"The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.",
Password in Configuration File,Base,Incomplete,The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors who do not know the password.,"This can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the password to one of their choosing."
Weak Encoding for Password,Base,Incomplete,Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.,"Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password."
Not Using Password Aging,Base,Draft,The product does not have a mechanism in place for managing password aging.,"Password aging (or password rotation) is a policy that forces users to change their passwords after a defined time period passes, such as every 30 or 90 days. Without mechanisms such as aging, users might not change their passwords in a timely manner. Note that while password aging was once considered an important security feature, it has since fallen out of favor by many, because it is not as effective against modern threats compared to other mechanisms such as slow hashes. In addition, forcing frequent changes can unintentionally encourage users to select less-secure passwords. However, password aging is still in use due to factors such as compliance requirements, e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)."
Password Aging with Long Expiration,Base,Draft,"The product supports password aging, but the expiration period is too long.","Password aging (or password rotation) is a policy that forces users to change their passwords after a defined time period passes, such as every 30 or 90 days. A long expiration provides more time for attackers to conduct password cracking before users are forced to change to a new password. Note that while password aging was once considered an important security feature, it has since fallen out of favor by many, because it is not as effective against modern threats compared to other mechanisms such as slow hashes. In addition, forcing frequent changes can unintentionally encourage users to select less-secure passwords. However, password aging is still in use due to factors such as compliance requirements, e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)."
Incorrect Privilege Assignment,Base,Draft,"A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.",
Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions,Base,Incomplete,"A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.",
Privilege Chaining,Base,Draft,"Two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights can be combined in a way that allows an entity to perform unsafe actions that would not be allowed without that combination.",
Privilege Context Switching Error,Base,Draft,The product does not properly manage privileges while it is switching between different contexts that have different privileges or spheres of control.,
Least Privilege Violation,Base,Incomplete,The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as chroot() should be dropped immediately after the operation is performed.,
Improper Check for Dropped Privileges,Base,Incomplete,The product attempts to drop privileges but does not check or incorrectly checks to see if the drop succeeded.,"If the drop fails, the product will continue to run with the raised privileges, which might provide additional access to unprivileged users."
Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges,Base,Draft,"The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.",
Incorrect Default Permissions,Base,Draft,"During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.",
Insecure Inherited Permissions,Variant,Draft,A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.,
Insecure Preserved Inherited Permissions,Variant,Incomplete,"A product inherits a set of insecure permissions for an object, e.g. when copying from an archive file, without user awareness or involvement.",
Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions,Variant,Draft,"While it is executing, the product sets the permissions of an object in a way that violates the intended permissions that have been specified by the user.",
"Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges ",Base,Draft,The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.,
Improper Preservation of Permissions,Base,Draft,"The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them to have less restrictive permissions than intended.",
Unverified Ownership,Base,Draft,The product does not properly verify that a critical resource is owned by the proper entity.,
Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel,Base,Incomplete,"A product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.",
Authentication Bypass by Spoofing,Base,Incomplete,This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.,
Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay,Base,Incomplete,A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).,"Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server."
Improper Certificate Validation,Base,Draft,"The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.","When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host."
Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust,Base,Draft,"The product does not follow, or incorrectly follows, the chain of trust for a certificate back to a trusted root certificate, resulting in incorrect trust of any resource that is associated with that certificate.","If a system does not follow the chain of trust of a certificate to a root server, the certificate loses all usefulness as a metric of trust. Essentially, the trust gained from a certificate is derived from a chain of trust -- with a reputable trusted entity at the end of that list. The end user must trust that reputable source, and this reputable source must vouch for the resource in question through the medium of the certificate. In some cases, this trust traverses several entities who vouch for one another. The entity trusted by the end user is at one end of this trust chain, while the certificate-wielding resource is at the other end of the chain. If the user receives a certificate at the end of one of these trust chains and then proceeds to check only that the first link in the chain, no real trust has been derived, since the entire chain must be traversed back to a trusted source to verify the certificate. There are several ways in which the chain of trust might be broken, including but not limited to: Any certificate in the chain is self-signed, unless it the root. Not every intermediate certificate is checked, starting from the original certificate all the way up to the root certificate. An intermediate, CA-signed certificate does not have the expected Basic Constraints or other important extensions. The root certificate has been compromised or authorized to the wrong party."
Improper Check for Certificate Revocation,Base,Draft,"The product does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.","An improper check for certificate revocation is a far more serious flaw than related certificate failures. This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync."
Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm,Base,Draft,"The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.",This incorrect implementation may allow authentication to be bypassed.
Missing Critical Step in Authentication,Base,Draft,"The product implements an authentication technique, but it skips a step that weakens the technique.","Authentication techniques should follow the algorithms that define them exactly, otherwise authentication can be bypassed or more easily subjected to brute force attacks."
Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness,Base,Draft,"The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.",
Missing Authentication for Critical Function,Base,Draft,The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.,"As data is migrated to the cloud, if access does not require authentication, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet."
Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts,Base,Draft,"The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.",
Use of Single-factor Authentication,Base,Draft,The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication scheme.,"While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on more complexity on top of authentication, it is inestimably valuable to have such measures of redundancy. The use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet. Without the added protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the compromise of an account. For this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy to use, they should be implemented and required."
Use of Password System for Primary Authentication,Base,Draft,"The use of password systems as the primary means of authentication may be subject to several flaws or shortcomings, each reducing the effectiveness of the mechanism.",
Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.,"Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information. When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet. In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of double encryption (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment."
Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in GUI,Variant,Draft,The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within the GUI.,"An attacker can often obtain data from a GUI, even if hidden, by using an API to directly access GUI objects such as windows and menus. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information."
Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.,"Many communication channels can be sniffed (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data. Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries. When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to sniff the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself."
Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key,Variant,Draft,The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.,
Key Exchange without Entity Authentication,Base,Draft,The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.,"Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc."
"Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption",Variant,Incomplete,Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.,
Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date,Base,Draft,"The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks against that key.","While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is a significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys within a period of time proportional to their strength."
Missing Cryptographic Step,Base,Draft,"The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.",
Use of Weak Hash,Base,Draft,"The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).","A hash function is defined as an algorithm that maps arbitrarily sized data into a fixed-sized digest (output) such that the following properties hold: 1. The algorithm is not invertible (also called one-way or not reversible) 2. The algorithm is deterministic; the same input produces the same digest every time Building on this definition, a cryptographic hash function must also ensure that a malicious actor cannot leverage the hash function to have a reasonable chance of success at determining any of the following: 1. the original input (preimage attack), given only the digest 2. another input that can produce the same digest (2nd preimage attack), given the original input 3. a set of two or more inputs that evaluate to the same digest (birthday attack), given the actor can arbitrarily choose the inputs to be hashed and can do so a reasonable amount of times What is regarded as reasonable varies by context and threat model, but in general, reasonable could cover any attack that is more efficient than brute force (i.e., on average, attempting half of all possible combinations). Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world. Any algorithm does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing. In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a rainbow table [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2."
Insufficient Entropy,Base,Draft,"The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.",
Small Space of Random Values,Base,Draft,"The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.",
Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG),Base,Draft,The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.,"PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG. Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered."
Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG),Base,Draft,"The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.","When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks. Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography."
Predictable from Observable State,Base,Draft,"A number or object is predictable based on observations that the attacker can make about the state of the system or network, such as time, process ID, etc.",
Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values,Base,Draft,An exact value or random number can be precisely predicted by observing previous values.,
Predictable Value Range from Previous Values,Base,Draft,"The product's random number generator produces a series of values which, when observed, can be used to infer a relatively small range of possibilities for the next value that could be generated.","The output of a random number generator should not be predictable based on observations of previous values. In some cases, an attacker cannot predict the exact value that will be produced next, but can narrow down the possibilities significantly. This reduces the amount of effort to perform a brute force attack. For example, suppose the product generates random numbers between 1 and 100, but it always produces a larger value until it reaches 100. If the generator produces an 80, then the attacker knows that the next value will be somewhere between 81 and 100. Instead of 100 possibilities, the attacker only needs to consider 20."
Origin Validation Error,Class,Draft,The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.,
Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature,Base,Draft,"The product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.",
Use of Less Trusted Source,Base,Draft,"The product has two different sources of the same data or information, but it uses the source that has less support for verification, is less trusted, or is less resistant to attack.",
Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data,Base,Draft,"The product, when processing trusted data, accepts any untrusted data that is also included with the trusted data, treating the untrusted data as if it were trusted.",
Insufficient Type Distinction,Base,Draft,The product does not properly distinguish between different types of elements in a way that leads to insecure behavior.,
Missing Support for Integrity Check,Base,Draft,"The product uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data during transmission, such as a checksum.","If integrity check values or checksums are omitted from a protocol, there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications, the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum, since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages, as opposed to single packets."
Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value,Base,Draft,The product does not validate or incorrectly validates the integrity check values or checksums of a message. This may prevent it from detecting if the data has been modified or corrupted in transmission.,Improper validation of checksums before use results in an unnecessary risk that can easily be mitigated. The protocol specification describes the algorithm used for calculating the checksum. It is then a simple matter of implementing the calculation and verifying that the calculated checksum and the received checksum match. Improper verification of the calculated checksum and the received checksum can lead to far greater consequences.
Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions,Base,Incomplete,The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting damage to their system.,"Product systems should warn users that a potentially dangerous action may occur if the user proceeds. For example, if the user downloads a file from an unknown source and attempts to execute the file on their machine, then the application's GUI can indicate that the file is unsafe."
Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations,Base,Draft,"The user interface provides a warning to a user regarding dangerous or sensitive operations, but the warning is not noticeable enough to warrant attention.",
Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.","There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation. Some types of private information include: Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers Geographic location - where the user is (or was) Employment history Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts Pictures, video, or audio Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc. Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc. Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc. Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records Account passwords and other credentials Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry. Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private."
Race Condition Enabling Link Following,Base,Draft,"The product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.","While developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks."
Signal Handler Race Condition,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.,"Race conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution. These issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the regular code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered. There are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of signal handler race condition: Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and regular code Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution. Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses. Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses. Signal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code: Avoiding shared state Using synchronization in the signal handler Using synchronization in the regular code Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)"
Race Condition within a Thread,Base,Draft,"If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.",
Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition,Base,Incomplete,"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.","This weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs."
Context Switching Race Condition,Base,Draft,"A product performs a series of non-atomic actions to switch between contexts that cross privilege or other security boundaries, but a race condition allows an attacker to modify or misrepresent the product's behavior during the switch.","This is commonly seen in web browser vulnerabilities in which the attacker can perform certain actions while the browser is transitioning from a trusted to an untrusted domain, or vice versa, and the browser performs the actions on one domain using the trust level and resources of the other domain."
Divide By Zero,Base,Draft,The product divides a value by zero.,"This weakness typically occurs when an unexpected value is provided to the product, or if an error occurs that is not properly detected. It frequently occurs in calculations involving physical dimensions such as size, length, width, and height."
Incomplete Internal State Distinction,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly determine which state it is in, causing it to assume it is in state X when in fact it is in state Y, causing it to perform incorrect operations in a security-relevant manner.",
Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method,Base,Draft,The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.,"The function or method that has been called can alter or delete the mutable data. This could violate assumptions that the calling function has made about its state. In situations where unknown code is called with references to mutable data, this external code could make changes to the data sent. If this data was not previously cloned, the modified data might not be valid in the context of execution."
Returning a Mutable Object to an Untrusted Caller,Base,Draft,Sending non-cloned mutable data as a return value may result in that data being altered or deleted by the calling function.,"In situations where functions return references to mutable data, it is possible that the external code which called the function may make changes to the data sent. If this data was not previously cloned, the class will then be using modified data which may violate assumptions about its internal state."
Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions,Base,Draft,"Opening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.",
Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions,Base,Incomplete,The product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.,"On some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached."
Covert Timing Channel,Base,Incomplete,"Covert timing channels convey information by modulating some aspect of system behavior over time, so that the program receiving the information can observe system behavior and infer protected information.","In some instances, knowing when data is transmitted between parties can provide a malicious user with privileged information. Also, externally monitoring the timing of operations can potentially reveal sensitive data. For example, a cryptographic operation can expose its internal state if the time it takes to perform the operation varies, based on the state. Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Some examples of covert timing channels are the system's paging rate, the time a certain transaction requires to execute, and the time it takes to gain access to a shared bus."
Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object,Base,Draft,"A constant symbolic reference to an object is used, even though the reference can resolve to a different object over time.",
Detection of Error Condition Without Action,Base,Draft,"The product detects a specific error, but takes no actions to handle the error.",
Unchecked Error Condition,Base,Incomplete,"[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION. SEE MAINTENANCE NOTES AND CONSIDER CWE-252, CWE-248, OR CWE-1069.] Ignoring exceptions and other error conditions may allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior unnoticed.",
Missing Report of Error Condition,Base,Draft,The product encounters an error but does not provide a status code or return value to indicate that an error has occurred.,
Return of Wrong Status Code,Base,Draft,"A function or operation returns an incorrect return value or status code that does not indicate an error, but causes the product to modify its behavior based on the incorrect result.","This can lead to unpredictable behavior. If the function is used to make security-critical decisions or provide security-critical information, then the wrong status code can cause the product to assume that an action is safe, even when it is not."
Unexpected Status Code or Return Value,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly check when a function or operation returns a value that is legitimate for the function, but is not expected by the product.",
Use of NullPointerException Catch to Detect NULL Pointer Dereference,Base,Draft,Catching NullPointerException should not be used as an alternative to programmatic checks to prevent dereferencing a null pointer.,"Programmers typically catch NullPointerException under three circumstances: The program contains a null pointer dereference. Catching the resulting exception was easier than fixing the underlying problem. The program explicitly throws a NullPointerException to signal an error condition. The code is part of a test harness that supplies unexpected input to the classes under test. Of these three circumstances, only the last is acceptable."
Declaration of Catch for Generic Exception,Base,Draft,Catching overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.,"Multiple catch blocks can get ugly and repetitive, but condensing catch blocks by catching a high-level class like Exception can obscure exceptions that deserve special treatment or that should not be caught at this point in the program. Catching an overly broad exception essentially defeats the purpose of Java's typed exceptions, and can become particularly dangerous if the program grows and begins to throw new types of exceptions. The new exception types will not receive any attention."
Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception,Base,Draft,Throwing overly broad exceptions promotes complex error handling code that is more likely to contain security vulnerabilities.,"Declaring a method to throw Exception or Throwable makes it difficult for callers to perform proper error handling and error recovery. Java's exception mechanism, for example, is set up to make it easy for callers to anticipate what can go wrong and write code to handle each specific exceptional circumstance. Declaring that a method throws a generic form of exception defeats this system."
Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak'),Base,Draft,"A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.","When a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file."
Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification,Base,Draft,The product allows an entity to perform a legitimate but expensive operation before authentication or authorization has taken place.,
Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification),Base,Incomplete,The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.,"An example of data amplification is a decompression bomb, a small ZIP file that can produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed."
Insufficient Resource Pool,Base,Incomplete,"The product's resource pool is not large enough to handle peak demand, which allows an attacker to prevent others from accessing the resource by using a (relatively) large number of requests for resources.",Frequently the consequence is a flood of connection or sessions.
Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock,Base,Incomplete,"The product properly checks for the existence of a lock, but the lock can be externally controlled or influenced by an actor that is outside of the intended sphere of control.","This prevents the product from acting on associated resources or performing other behaviors that are controlled by the presence of the lock. Relevant locks might include an exclusive lock or mutex, or modifying a shared resource that is treated as a lock. If the lock can be held for an indefinite period of time, then the denial of service could be permanent."
Improper Resource Locking,Base,Draft,The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.,"When a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors."
Missing Lock Check,Base,Draft,A product does not check to see if a lock is present before performing sensitive operations on a resource.,
Unprotected Primary Channel,Base,Draft,"The product uses a primary channel for administration or restricted functionality, but it does not properly protect the channel.",
Unprotected Alternate Channel,Base,Draft,"The product protects a primary channel, but it does not use the same level of protection for an alternate channel.",
Race Condition During Access to Alternate Channel,Base,Draft,"The product opens an alternate channel to communicate with an authorized user, but the channel is accessible to other actors.",This creates a race condition that allows an attacker to access the channel before the authorized user does.
Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'),Base,Incomplete,"The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.",Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.
Untrusted Search Path,Base,Stable,The product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.,"This might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts. Some of the most common variants of untrusted search path are: In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library. In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order."
Uncontrolled Search Path Element,Base,Draft,"The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.","Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as /tmp or the current working directory. In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled: the directory from which the program has been loaded the current working directory In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used. One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled. In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element. In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element."
Unquoted Search Path or Element,Base,Draft,"The product uses a search path that contains an unquoted element, in which the element contains whitespace or other separators. This can cause the product to access resources in a parent path.","If a malicious individual has access to the file system, it is possible to elevate privileges by inserting such a file as C:Program.exe to be run by a privileged program making use of WinExec."
Deployment of Wrong Handler,Base,Incomplete,The wrong handler is assigned to process an object.,"An example of deploying the wrong handler would be calling a servlet to reveal source code of a .JSP file, or automatically determining type of the object even if it is contradictory to an explicitly specified type."
Missing Handler,Base,Draft,A handler is not available or implemented.,"When an exception is thrown and not caught, the process has given up an opportunity to decide if a given failure or event is worth a change in execution."
Dangerous Signal Handler not Disabled During Sensitive Operations,Base,Draft,"The product uses a signal handler that shares state with other signal handlers, but it does not properly mask or prevent those signal handlers from being invoked while the original signal handler is still running.","During the execution of a signal handler, it can be interrupted by another handler when a different signal is sent. If the two handlers share state - such as global variables - then an attacker can corrupt the state by sending another signal before the first handler has completed execution."
Unparsed Raw Web Content Delivery,Variant,Incomplete,The product stores raw content or supporting code under the web document root with an extension that is not specifically handled by the server.,"If code is stored in a file with an extension such as .inc or .pl, and the web server does not have a handler for that extension, then the server will likely send the contents of the file directly to the requester without the pre-processing that was expected. When that file contains sensitive information such as database credentials, this may allow the attacker to compromise the application or associated components."
Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type,Base,Draft,The product allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.,
Incomplete Model of Endpoint Features,Base,Incomplete,"A product acts as an intermediary or monitor between two or more endpoints, but it does not have a complete model of an endpoint's features, behaviors, or state, potentially causing the product to perform incorrect actions based on this incomplete model.",
Behavioral Change in New Version or Environment,Base,Draft,"A's behavior or functionality changes with a new version of A, or a new environment, which is not known (or manageable) by B.",
Expected Behavior Violation,Base,Draft,"A feature, API, or function does not perform according to its specification.",
Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling'),Base,Incomplete,"The product acts as an intermediary HTTP agent (such as a proxy or firewall) in the data flow between two entities such as a client and server, but it does not interpret malformed HTTP requests or responses in ways that are consistent with how the messages will be processed by those entities that are at the ultimate destination.","HTTP requests or responses (messages) can be malformed or unexpected in ways that cause web servers or clients to interpret the messages in different ways than intermediary HTTP agents such as load balancers, reverse proxies, web caching proxies, application firewalls, etc. For example, an adversary may be able to add duplicate or different header fields that a client or server might interpret as one set of messages, whereas the intermediary might interpret the same sequence of bytes as a different set of messages. For example, discrepancies can arise in how to handle duplicate headers like two Transfer-encoding (TE) or two Content-length (CL), or the malicious HTTP message will have different headers for TE and CL. The inconsistent parsing and interpretation of messages can allow the adversary to smuggle a message to the client/server without the intermediary being aware of it. This weakness is usually the result of the usage of outdated or incompatible HTTP protocol versions in the HTTP agents."
Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in UI,Base,Draft,"A UI function for a security feature appears to be supported and gives feedback to the user that suggests that it is supported, but the underlying functionality is not implemented.",
Obsolete Feature in UI,Base,Draft,A UI function is obsolete and the product does not warn the user.,
The UI Performs the Wrong Action,Base,Incomplete,The UI performs the wrong action with respect to the user's request.,
Multiple Interpretations of UI Input,Base,Draft,The UI has multiple interpretations of user input but does not prompt the user when it selects the less secure interpretation.,
External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores,Base,Draft,The product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.,"A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary, especially if they are initialized by users. The variables may have been initialized incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do."
Non-exit on Failed Initialization,Base,Draft,"The product does not exit or otherwise modify its operation when security-relevant errors occur during initialization, such as when a configuration file has a format error or a hardware security module (HSM) cannot be activated, which can cause the product to execute in a less secure fashion than intended by the administrator.",
Incomplete Cleanup,Base,Draft,The product does not properly clean up and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.,
Improper Cleanup on Thrown Exception,Base,Draft,"The product does not clean up its state or incorrectly cleans up its state when an exception is thrown, leading to unexpected state or control flow.","Often, when functions or loops become complicated, some level of resource cleanup is needed throughout execution. Exceptions can disturb the flow of the code and prevent the necessary cleanup from happening."
Duplicate Key in Associative List (Alist),Base,Incomplete,Duplicate keys in associative lists can lead to non-unique keys being mistaken for an error.,"A duplicate key entry -- if the alist is designed properly -- could be used as a constant time replace function. However, duplicate key entries could be inserted by mistake. Because of this ambiguity, duplicate key entries in an association list are not recommended and should not be allowed."
Deletion of Data Structure Sentinel,Base,Incomplete,The accidental deletion of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.,"Often times data-structure sentinels are used to mark structure of the data structure. A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings. Another common example is linked lists which may contain a sentinel to mark the end of the list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the deletion or modification outside of some wrapper interface which provides safety."
Addition of Data Structure Sentinel,Base,Incomplete,The accidental addition of a data-structure sentinel can cause serious programming logic problems.,"Data-structure sentinels are often used to mark the structure of data. A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings or a special sentinel to mark the end of a linked list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the addition or modification of sentinels."
Return of Pointer Value Outside of Expected Range,Base,Draft,A function can return a pointer to memory that is outside of the buffer that the pointer is expected to reference.,
Use of sizeof() on a Pointer Type,Variant,Draft,"The code calls sizeof() on a malloced pointer type, which always returns the wordsize/8. This can produce an unexpected result if the programmer intended to determine how much memory has been allocated.","The use of sizeof() on a pointer can sometimes generate useful information. An obvious case is to find out the wordsize on a platform. More often than not, the appearance of sizeof(pointer) indicates a bug."
Incorrect Pointer Scaling,Base,Incomplete,"In C and C++, one may often accidentally refer to the wrong memory due to the semantics of when math operations are implicitly scaled.",
Use of Pointer Subtraction to Determine Size,Base,Draft,"The product subtracts one pointer from another in order to determine size, but this calculation can be incorrect if the pointers do not exist in the same memory chunk.",
Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'),Base,Draft,"The product uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not sufficiently prevent the input from selecting improper classes or code.","If the product uses external inputs to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, then an attacker could supply values to select unexpected classes or methods. If this occurs, then the attacker could create control flow paths that were not intended by the developer. These paths could bypass authentication or access control checks, or otherwise cause the product to behave in an unexpected manner. This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the product's classpath (CWE-427) or add new entries to the product's classpath (CWE-426). Under either of these conditions, the attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the product."
Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID),Base,Draft,The product does not properly protect an assumed-immutable element from being modified by an attacker.,"This occurs when a particular input is critical enough to the functioning of the application that it should not be modifiable at all, but it is. Certain resources are often assumed to be immutable when they are not, such as hidden form fields in web applications, cookies, and reverse DNS lookups."
External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter,Base,Draft,"The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.","If a web product does not properly protect assumed-immutable values from modification in hidden form fields, parameters, cookies, or URLs, this can lead to modification of critical data. Web applications often mistakenly make the assumption that data passed to the client in hidden fields or cookies is not susceptible to tampering. Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input. For example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control. Thus, the cookies might contain sensitive data such as user credentials and privileges. This is a dangerous practice, as it can often lead to improper reliance on the value of the client-provided cookie by the server side application."
Use of Function with Inconsistent Implementations,Base,Draft,The code uses a function that has inconsistent implementations across operating systems and versions.,"The use of inconsistent implementations can cause changes in behavior when the code is ported or built under a different environment than the programmer expects, which can lead to security problems in some cases. The implementation of many functions varies by platform, and at times, even by different versions of the same platform. Implementation differences can include: Slight differences in the way parameters are interpreted leading to inconsistent results. Some implementations of the function carry significant security risks. The function might not be defined on all platforms. The function might change which return codes it can provide, or change the meaning of its return codes."
Undefined Behavior for Input to API,Base,Incomplete,The behavior of this function is undefined unless its control parameter is set to a specific value.,
NULL Pointer Dereference,Base,Stable,"A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.","NULL pointer dereference issues can occur through a number of flaws, including race conditions, and simple programming omissions."
Use of Obsolete Function,Base,Draft,"The code uses deprecated or obsolete functions, which suggests that the code has not been actively reviewed or maintained.","As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to: Advances in the language Improved understanding of how operations should be performed effectively and securely Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations Functions that are removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some different and hopefully improved way."
Missing Default Case in Multiple Condition Expression,Base,Draft,"The code does not have a default case in an expression with multiple conditions, such as a switch statement.","If a multiple-condition expression (such as a switch in C) omits the default case but does not consider or handle all possible values that could occur, then this might lead to complex logical errors and resultant weaknesses. Because of this, further decisions are made based on poor information, and cascading failure results. This cascading failure may result in any number of security issues, and constitutes a significant failure in the system."
Signal Handler Use of a Non-reentrant Function,Variant,Draft,The product defines a signal handler that calls a non-reentrant function.,"Non-reentrant functions are functions that cannot safely be called, interrupted, and then recalled before the first call has finished without resulting in memory corruption. This can lead to an unexpected system state and unpredictable results with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution. Many functions are not reentrant, but some of them can result in the corruption of memory if they are used in a signal handler. The function call syslog() is an example of this. In order to perform its functionality, it allocates a small amount of memory as scratch space. If syslog() is suspended by a signal call and the signal handler calls syslog(), the memory used by both of these functions enters an undefined, and possibly, exploitable state. Implementations of malloc() and free() manage metadata in global structures in order to track which memory is allocated versus which memory is available, but they are non-reentrant. Simultaneous calls to these functions can cause corruption of the metadata."
Use of Incorrect Operator,Base,Draft,"The product accidentally uses the wrong operator, which changes the logic in security-relevant ways.",These types of errors are generally the result of a typo by the programmer.
Incorrect Block Delimitation,Base,Draft,"The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more statements, creating a logic error.","In some languages, braces (or other delimiters) are optional for blocks. When the delimiter is omitted, it is possible to insert a logic error in which a statement is thought to be in a block but is not. In some cases, the logic error can have security implications."
Omitted Break Statement in Switch,Base,Draft,"The product omits a break statement within a switch or similar construct, causing code associated with multiple conditions to execute. This can cause problems when the programmer only intended to execute code associated with one condition.",This can lead to critical code executing in situations where it should not.
Reliance on Package-level Scope,Base,Incomplete,"Java packages are not inherently closed; therefore, relying on them for code security is not a good practice.",The purpose of package scope is to prevent accidental access by other parts of a program. This is an ease-of-software-development feature but not a security feature.
Exposure of Data Element to Wrong Session,Base,Draft,"The product does not sufficiently enforce boundaries between the states of different sessions, causing data to be provided to, or used by, the wrong session.","Data can bleed from one session to another through member variables of singleton objects, such as Servlets, and objects from a shared pool. In the case of Servlets, developers sometimes do not understand that, unless a Servlet implements the SingleThreadModel interface, the Servlet is a singleton; there is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads. A common result is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition."
Active Debug Code,Base,Draft,"The product is deployed to unauthorized actors with debugging code still enabled or active, which can create unintended entry points or expose sensitive information.",A common development practice is to add back door code specifically designed for debugging or testing purposes that is not intended to be shipped or deployed with the product. These back door entry points create security risks because they are not considered during design or testing and fall outside of the expected operating conditions of the product.
Download of Code Without Integrity Check,Base,Draft,The product downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and executes the code without sufficiently verifying the origin and integrity of the code.,"An attacker can execute malicious code by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or modifying the code in transit."
Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere,Base,Incomplete,The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.,"Network-based products, such as web applications, often run on top of an operating system or similar environment. When the product communicates with outside parties, details about the underlying system are expected to remain hidden, such as path names for data files, other OS users, installed packages, the application environment, etc. This system information may be provided by the product itself, or buried within diagnostic or debugging messages. Debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form an attack plan. An information exposure occurs when system data or debugging information leaves the program through an output stream or logging function that makes it accessible to unauthorized parties. Using other weaknesses, an attacker could cause errors to occur; the response to these errors can reveal detailed system information, along with other impacts. An attacker can use messages that reveal technologies, operating systems, and product versions to tune the attack against known vulnerabilities in these technologies. A product may use diagnostic methods that provide significant implementation details such as stack traces as part of its error handling mechanism."
Trust Boundary Violation,Base,Draft,The product mixes trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure or structured message.,"A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely cross the trust boundary - to move from untrusted to trusted. A trust boundary violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what is untrusted. By combining trusted and untrusted data in the same data structure, it becomes easier for programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated data."
Deserialization of Untrusted Data,Base,Draft,The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.,"It is often convenient to serialize objects for communication or to save them for later use. However, deserialized data or code can often be modified without using the provided accessor functions if it does not use cryptography to protect itself. Furthermore, any cryptography would still be client-side security -- which is a dangerous security assumption. Data that is untrusted can not be trusted to be well-formed. When developers place no restrictions on gadget chains, or series of instances and method invocations that can self-execute during the deserialization process (i.e., before the object is returned to the caller), it is sometimes possible for attackers to leverage them to perform unauthorized actions, like generating a shell."
Covert Storage Channel,Base,Incomplete,A covert storage channel transfers information through the setting of bits by one program and the reading of those bits by another. What distinguishes this case from that of ordinary operation is that the bits are used to convey encoded information.,"Covert storage channels occur when out-of-band data is stored in messages for the purpose of memory reuse. Covert channels are frequently classified as either storage or timing channels. Examples would include using a file intended to hold only audit information to convey user passwords--using the name of a file or perhaps status bits associated with it that can be read by all users to signal the contents of the file. Steganography, concealing information in such a manner that no one but the intended recipient knows of the existence of the message, is a good example of a covert storage channel."
Weak Password Requirements,Base,Draft,"The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.",Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It is therefore important that this password be of sufficient complexity and impractical for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the correct password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to the overall success of the authentication mechanism.
Unprotected Transport of Credentials,Base,Incomplete,Login pages do not use adequate measures to protect the user name and password while they are in transit from the client to the server.,
Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Incomplete,"The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an actor outside of the intended control sphere.","Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating with remote entities or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a pool of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to minimize the time it takes to initialize and access these resources. If the cache is accessible to unauthorized actors, attackers can read the cache and obtain this sensitive information."
Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File,Base,Incomplete,Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.,"While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, it is important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product ships so that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed to potential attackers. Different log files may be produced and stored for: Server log files (e.g. server.log). This can give information on whatever application left the file. Usually this can give full path names and system information, and sometimes usernames and passwords. log files that are used for debugging"
Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code,Base,Incomplete,Source code on a web server or repository often contains sensitive information and should generally not be accessible to users.,"There are situations where it is critical to remove source code from an area or server. For example, obtaining Perl source code on a system allows an attacker to understand the logic of the script and extract extremely useful information such as code bugs or logins and passwords."
Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism,Base,Draft,"The product does not use a standardized method for handling errors throughout the code, which might introduce inconsistent error handling and resultant weaknesses.","If the product handles error messages individually, on a one-by-one basis, this is likely to result in inconsistent error handling. The causes of errors may be lost. Also, detailed information about the causes of an error may be unintentionally returned to the user."
Suspicious Comment,Variant,Draft,"The code contains comments that suggest the presence of bugs, incomplete functionality, or weaknesses.","Many suspicious comments, such as BUG, HACK, FIXME, LATER, LATER2, TODO, in the code indicate missing security functionality and checking. Others indicate code problems that programmers should fix, such as hard-coded variables, error handling, not using stored procedures, and performance issues."
"Use of Hard-coded, Security-relevant Constants",Variant,Draft,"The product uses hard-coded constants instead of symbolic names for security-critical values, which increases the likelihood of mistakes during code maintenance or security policy change.","If the developer does not find all occurrences of the hard-coded constants, an incorrect policy decision may be made if one of the constants is not changed. Making changes to these values will require code changes that may be difficult or impossible once the system is released to the field. In addition, these hard-coded values may become available to attackers if the code is ever disclosed."
Missing Password Field Masking,Base,Draft,"The product does not mask passwords during entry, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture passwords.",
Incorrect Behavior Order: Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization,Base,Incomplete,"If a web server does not fully parse requested URLs before it examines them for authorization, it may be possible for an attacker to bypass authorization protection.","For instance, the character strings /./ and / both mean current directory. If /SomeDirectory is a protected directory and an attacker requests /./SomeDirectory, the attacker may be able to gain access to the resource if /./ is not converted to / before the authorization check is performed."
Dead Code,Base,Draft,"The product contains dead code, which can never be executed.",Dead code is code that can never be executed in a running program. The surrounding code makes it impossible for a section of code to ever be executed.
Return of Stack Variable Address,Base,Draft,"A function returns the address of a stack variable, which will cause unintended program behavior, typically in the form of a crash.","Because local variables are allocated on the stack, when a program returns a pointer to a local variable, it is returning a stack address. A subsequent function call is likely to re-use this same stack address, thereby overwriting the value of the pointer, which no longer corresponds to the same variable since a function's stack frame is invalidated when it returns. At best this will cause the value of the pointer to change unexpectedly. In many cases it causes the program to crash the next time the pointer is dereferenced."
Assignment to Variable without Use,Variant,Draft,"The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store.","After the assignment, the variable is either assigned another value or goes out of scope. It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused variable points out a bug."
Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking,Base,Incomplete,"The product relies on the existence or values of cookies when performing security-critical operations, but it does not properly ensure that the setting is valid for the associated user.","Attackers can easily modify cookies, within the browser or by implementing the client-side code outside of the browser. Reliance on cookies without detailed validation and integrity checking can allow attackers to bypass authentication, conduct injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, or otherwise modify inputs in unexpected ways."
Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads, which can lead to undefined behavior and unpredictable data changes.","Within servlets, shared static variables are not protected from concurrent access, but servlets are multithreaded. This is a typical programming mistake in J2EE applications, since the multithreading is handled by the framework. When a shared variable can be influenced by an attacker, one thread could wind up modifying the variable to contain data that is not valid for a different thread that is also using the data within the variable. Note that this weakness is not unique to servlets."
Expression is Always False,Base,Draft,The product contains an expression that will always evaluate to false.,
Expression is Always True,Base,Draft,The product contains an expression that will always evaluate to true.,
clone() Method Without super.clone(),Variant,Draft,The product contains a clone() method that does not call super.clone() to obtain the new object.,"All implementations of clone() should obtain the new object by calling super.clone(). If a class does not follow this convention, a subclass's clone() method will return an object of the wrong type."
Object Model Violation: Just One of Equals and Hashcode Defined,Base,Draft,The product does not maintain equal hashcodes for equal objects.,"Java objects are expected to obey a number of invariants related to equality. One of these invariants is that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. In other words, if a.equals(b) == true then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()."
Return Inside Finally Block,Base,Draft,"The code has a return statement inside a finally block, which will cause any thrown exception in the try block to be discarded.",
Empty Synchronized Block,Base,Draft,The product contains an empty synchronized block.,An empty synchronized block does not actually accomplish any synchronization and may indicate a troubled section of code. An empty synchronized block can occur because code no longer needed within the synchronized block is commented out without removing the synchronized block.
Explicit Call to Finalize(),Variant,Draft,The product makes an explicit call to the finalize() method from outside the finalizer.,"While the Java Language Specification allows an object's finalize() method to be called from outside the finalizer, doing so is usually a bad idea. For example, calling finalize() explicitly means that finalize() will be called more than once: the first time will be the explicit call and the last time will be the call that is made after the object is garbage collected."
Assignment of a Fixed Address to a Pointer,Base,Draft,The product sets a pointer to a specific address other than NULL or 0.,"Using a fixed address is not portable, because that address will probably not be valid in all environments or platforms."
Attempt to Access Child of a Non-structure Pointer,Variant,Incomplete,Casting a non-structure type to a structure type and accessing a field can lead to memory access errors or data corruption.,
Comparison of Object References Instead of Object Contents,Variant,Incomplete,"The product compares object references instead of the contents of the objects themselves, preventing it from detecting equivalent objects.","For example, in Java, comparing objects using == usually produces deceptive results, since the == operator compares object references rather than values; often, this means that using == for strings is actually comparing the strings' references, not their values."
Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison,Variant,Draft,"The product uses the wrong operator when comparing a string, such as using == when the .equals() method should be used instead.","In Java, using == or != to compare two strings for equality actually compares two objects for equality rather than their string values for equality. Chances are good that the two references will never be equal. While this weakness often only affects program correctness, if the equality is used for a security decision, the unintended comparison result could be leveraged to affect program security."
"Uncaught Exception in Servlet ",Base,Draft,"The Servlet does not catch all exceptions, which may reveal sensitive debugging information.","When a Servlet throws an exception, the default error response the Servlet container sends back to the user typically includes debugging information. This information is of great value to an attacker. For example, a stack trace might show the attacker a malformed SQL query string, the type of database being used, and the version of the application container. This information enables the attacker to target known vulnerabilities in these components."
URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect'),Base,Draft,"A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks.","An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance."
Use of Client-Side Authentication,Base,Draft,"A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code, allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the authentication check.",Client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of the application which would otherwise be protected.
Multiple Binds to the Same Port,Base,Draft,"When multiple sockets are allowed to bind to the same port, other services on that port may be stolen or spoofed.","On most systems, a combination of setting the SO_REUSEADDR socket option, and a call to bind() allows any process to bind to a port to which a previous process has bound with INADDR_ANY. This allows a user to bind to the specific address of a server bound to INADDR_ANY on an unprivileged port, and steal its UDP packets/TCP connection."
Unchecked Input for Loop Condition,Base,Draft,"The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.",
Double-Checked Locking,Base,Draft,"The product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.","Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block."
Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference,Base,Draft,"The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.","XML documents optionally contain a Document Type Definition (DTD), which, among other features, enables the definition of XML entities. It is possible to define an entity by providing a substitution string in the form of a URI. The XML parser can access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing. By submitting an XML file that defines an external entity with a file:// URI, an attacker can cause the processing application to read the contents of a local file. For example, a URI such as file:///c:/winnt/win.ini designates (in Windows) the file C:Winntwin.ini, or file:///etc/passwd designates the password file in Unix-based systems. Using URIs with other schemes such as http://, the attacker can force the application to make outgoing requests to servers that the attacker cannot reach directly, which can be used to bypass firewall restrictions or hide the source of attacks such as port scanning. Once the content of the URI is read, it is fed back into the application that is processing the XML. This application may echo back the data (e.g. in an error message), thereby exposing the file contents."
Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information,Base,Draft,"The product creates a search index of private or sensitive documents, but it does not properly limit index access to actors who are authorized to see the original information.","Web sites and other document repositories may apply an indexing routine against a group of private documents to facilitate search. If the index's results are available to parties who do not have access to the documents being indexed, then attackers could obtain portions of the documents by conducting targeted searches and reading the results. The risk is especially dangerous if search results include surrounding text that was not part of the search query. This issue can appear in search engines that are not configured (or implemented) to ignore critical files that should remain hidden; even without permissions to download these files directly, the remote user could read them."
Insufficient Session Expiration,Base,Incomplete,"According to WASC, Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.",
Reachable Assertion,Base,Draft,"The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.","While assertion is good for catching logic errors and reducing the chances of reaching more serious vulnerability conditions, it can still lead to a denial of service. For example, if a server handles multiple simultaneous connections, and an assert() occurs in one single connection that causes all other connections to be dropped, this is a reachable assertion that leads to a denial of service."
Exposed Unsafe ActiveX Method,Base,Incomplete,"An ActiveX control is intended for use in a web browser, but it exposes dangerous methods that perform actions that are outside of the browser's security model (e.g. the zone or domain).","ActiveX controls can exercise far greater control over the operating system than typical Java or javascript. Exposed methods can be subject to various vulnerabilities, depending on the implemented behaviors of those methods, and whether input validation is performed on the provided arguments. If there is no integrity checking or origin validation, this method could be invoked by attackers."
Dangling Database Cursor ('Cursor Injection'),Base,Incomplete,"If a database cursor is not closed properly, then it could become accessible to other users while retaining the same privileges that were originally assigned, leaving the cursor dangling.","For example, an improper dangling cursor could arise from unhandled exceptions. The impact of the issue depends on the cursor's role, but SQL injection attacks are commonly possible."
Unverified Password Change,Base,Draft,"When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.","This could be used by an attacker to change passwords for another user, thus gaining the privileges associated with that user."
Variable Extraction Error,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses external input to determine the names of variables into which information is extracted, without verifying that the names of the specified variables are valid. This could cause the program to overwrite unintended variables.","For example, in PHP, extraction can be used to provide functionality similar to register_globals, a dangerous functionality that is frequently disabled in production systems. Calling extract() or import_request_variables() without the proper arguments could allow arbitrary global variables to be overwritten, including superglobals. Similar functionality is possible in other interpreted languages, including custom languages."
Executable Regular Expression Error,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a regular expression that either (1) contains an executable component with user-controlled inputs, or (2) allows a user to enable execution by inserting pattern modifiers.","Case (2) is possible in the PHP preg_replace() function, and possibly in other languages when a user-controlled input is inserted into a string that is later parsed as a regular expression."
Permissive Regular Expression,Base,Draft,The product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.,"This effectively causes the regexp to accept substrings that match the pattern, which produces a partial comparison to the target. In some cases, this can lead to other weaknesses. Common errors include: not identifying the beginning and end of the target string using wildcards instead of acceptable character ranges others"
Dynamic Variable Evaluation,Base,Incomplete,"In a language where the user can influence the name of a variable at runtime, if the variable names are not controlled, an attacker can read or write to arbitrary variables, or access arbitrary functions.","The resultant vulnerabilities depend on the behavior of the application, both at the crossover point and in any control/data flow that is reachable by the related variables or functions."
Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments,Base,Draft,"The product calls a function, procedure, or routine with arguments that are not correctly specified, leading to always-incorrect behavior and resultant weaknesses.","There are multiple ways in which this weakness can be introduced, including: the wrong variable or reference; an incorrect number of arguments; incorrect order of arguments; wrong type of arguments; or wrong value."
Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key,Base,Incomplete,The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.,"Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system. For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value. One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data."
Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.","It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their password. Very often the password recovery mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme. This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system."
Improper Restriction of Names for Files and Other Resources,Base,Incomplete,"The product constructs the name of a file or other resource using input from an upstream component, but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the resulting name.","This may produce resultant weaknesses. For instance, if the names of these resources contain scripting characters, it is possible that a script may get executed in the client's browser if the application ever displays the name of the resource on a dynamically generated web page. Alternately, if the resources are consumed by some application parser, a specially crafted name can exploit some vulnerability internal to the parser, potentially resulting in execution of arbitrary code on the server machine. The problems will vary based on the context of usage of such malformed resource names and whether vulnerabilities are present in or assumptions are made by the targeted technology that would make code execution possible."
Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection'),Base,Incomplete,"The product uses external input to dynamically construct an XPath expression used to retrieve data from an XML database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes that input. This allows an attacker to control the structure of the query.","The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information selected from the XML database and may use that ability to control application flow, modify logic, retrieve unauthorized data, or bypass important checks (e.g. authentication)."
Overly Restrictive Account Lockout Mechanism,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains an account lockout protection mechanism, but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily, which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their accounts to be locked out.","Account lockout is a security feature often present in applications as a countermeasure to the brute force attack on the password based authentication mechanism of the system. After a certain number of failed login attempts, the users' account may be disabled for a certain period of time or until it is unlocked by an administrator. Other security events may also possibly trigger account lockout. However, an attacker may use this very security feature to deny service to legitimate system users. It is therefore important to ensure that the account lockout security mechanism is not overly restrictive."
Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs,Base,Incomplete,The product does not conform to the API requirements for a function call that requires extra privileges. This could allow attackers to gain privileges by causing the function to be called incorrectly.,"When a product contains certain functions that perform operations requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged API must be careful to: ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity of arguments account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the API call the API from a safe context If the caller of the API does not follow these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their privilege, hijack the process, or steal sensitive data. For instance, it is important to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the caller or if the privileged function might make certain assumptions about the data, context or state information passed to it by the caller. It is important to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited."
Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses obfuscation or encryption of inputs that should not be mutable by an external actor, but the product does not use integrity checks to detect if those inputs have been modified.","When an application relies on obfuscation or incorrectly applied / weak encryption to protect client-controllable tokens or parameters, that may have an effect on the user state, system state, or some decision made on the server. Without protecting the tokens/parameters for integrity, the application is vulnerable to an attack where an adversary traverses the space of possible values of the said token/parameter in order to attempt to gain an advantage. The goal of the attacker is to find another admissible value that will somehow elevate their privileges in the system, disclose information or change the behavior of the system in some way beneficial to the attacker. If the application does not protect these critical tokens/parameters for integrity, it will not be able to determine that these values have been tampered with. Measures that are used to protect data for confidentiality should not be relied upon to provide the integrity service."
Improper Neutralization of Data within XQuery Expressions ('XQuery Injection'),Base,Incomplete,"The product uses external input to dynamically construct an XQuery expression used to retrieve data from an XML database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes that input. This allows an attacker to control the structure of the query.","The net effect is that the attacker will have control over the information selected from the XML database and may use that ability to control application flow, modify logic, retrieve unauthorized data, or bypass important checks (e.g. authentication)."
Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context,Base,Draft,The product calls a non-reentrant function in a concurrent context in which a competing code sequence (e.g. thread or signal handler) may have an opportunity to call the same function or otherwise influence its state.,
Use of Potentially Dangerous Function,Base,Draft,"The product invokes a potentially dangerous function that could introduce a vulnerability if it is used incorrectly, but the function can also be used safely.",
Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types,Base,Draft,"When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.",
Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses multiple resources that can have the same identifier, in a context in which unique identifiers are required.","If the product assumes that each resource has a unique identifier, the product could operate on the wrong resource if attackers can cause multiple resources to be associated with the same identifier."
Use of Low-Level Functionality,Base,Incomplete,The product uses low-level functionality that is explicitly prohibited by the framework or specification under which the product is supposed to operate.,"The use of low-level functionality can violate the specification in unexpected ways that effectively disable built-in protection mechanisms, introduce exploitable inconsistencies, or otherwise expose the functionality to attack."
Execution After Redirect (EAR),Base,Incomplete,"The web application sends a redirect to another location, but instead of exiting, it executes additional code.",
Incorrect Ownership Assignment,Base,Incomplete,"The product assigns an owner to a resource, but the owner is outside of the intended control sphere.",This may allow the resource to be manipulated by actors outside of the intended control sphere.
Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code,Base,Incomplete,"The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the compiler optimizes the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.",
Exposed Dangerous Method or Function,Base,Incomplete,"The product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.","This weakness can lead to a wide variety of resultant weaknesses, depending on the behavior of the exposed method. It can apply to any number of technologies and approaches, such as ActiveX controls, Java functions, IOCTLs, and so on. The exposure can occur in a few different ways: The function/method was never intended to be exposed to outside actors. The function/method was only intended to be accessible to a limited set of actors, such as Internet-based access from a single web site."
Missing Custom Error Page,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not return custom error pages to the user, possibly exposing sensitive information.",
Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference,Base,Incomplete,"The product attempts to return a memory resource to the system, but it calls the wrong release function or calls the appropriate release function incorrectly.","This weakness can take several forms, such as: The memory was allocated, explicitly or implicitly, via one memory management method and deallocated using a different, non-compatible function (CWE-762). The function calls or memory management routines chosen are appropriate, however they are used incorrectly, such as in CWE-761."
Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product locks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system.","When a product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly locks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock, the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra locking calls will reduce the size of the total available pool, possibly leading to degraded performance or a denial of service. If this can be triggered by an attacker, it will be similar to an unrestricted lock (CWE-412). In the context of a binary lock, it is likely that any duplicate locking attempts will never succeed since the lock is already held and progress may not be possible."
Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product unlocks a critical resource more times than intended, leading to an unexpected state in the system.","When the product is operating in a concurrent environment and repeatedly unlocks a critical resource, the consequences will vary based on the type of lock, the lock's implementation, and the resource being protected. In some situations such as with semaphores, the resources are pooled and extra calls to unlock will increase the count for the number of available resources, likely resulting in a crash or unpredictable behavior when the system nears capacity."
Critical Data Element Declared Public,Variant,Incomplete,"The product declares a critical variable, field, or member to be public when intended security policy requires it to be private.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method,Variant,Incomplete,The product defines a public method that reads or modifies a private variable.,"If an attacker modifies the variable to contain unexpected values, this could violate assumptions from other parts of the code. Additionally, if an attacker can read the private variable, it may expose sensitive information or make it easier to launch further attacks."
Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling,Base,Incomplete,"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.","Code frequently has to work with limited resources, so programmers must be careful to ensure that resources are not consumed too quickly, or too easily. Without use of quotas, resource limits, or other protection mechanisms, it can be easy for an attacker to consume many resources by rapidly making many requests, or causing larger resources to be used than is needed. When too many resources are allocated, or if a single resource is too large, then it can prevent the code from working correctly, possibly leading to a denial of service."
Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product does not properly maintain a reference to a resource that has been allocated, which prevents the resource from being reclaimed.","This does not necessarily apply in languages or frameworks that automatically perform garbage collection, since the removal of all references may act as a signal that the resource is ready to be reclaimed."
Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime,Base,Draft,"The product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.","When a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to cause a denial of service by causing the allocation of resources without triggering their release. Frequently-affected resources include memory, CPU, disk space, power or battery, etc."
Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'),Base,Draft,"The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.","If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service."
Insufficient Logging,Base,Draft,"When a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.","When security-critical events are not logged properly, such as a failed login attempt, this can make malicious behavior more difficult to detect and may hinder forensic analysis after an attack succeeds. As organizations adopt cloud storage resources, these technologies often require configuration changes to enable detailed logging information, since detailed logging can incur additional costs. This could lead to telemetry gaps in critical audit logs. For example, in Azure, the default value for logging is disabled."
Logging of Excessive Data,Base,Draft,"The product logs too much information, making log files hard to process and possibly hindering recovery efforts or forensic analysis after an attack.","While logging is a good practice in general, and very high levels of logging are appropriate for debugging stages of development, too much logging in a production environment might hinder a system administrator's ability to detect anomalous conditions. This can provide cover for an attacker while attempting to penetrate a system, clutter the audit trail for forensic analysis, or make it more difficult to debug problems in a production environment."
Operator Precedence Logic Error,Base,Draft,The product uses an expression in which operator precedence causes incorrect logic to be used.,"While often just a bug, operator precedence logic errors can have serious consequences if they are used in security-critical code, such as making an authentication decision."
Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer,Base,Incomplete,The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.,"This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used."
Out-of-bounds Write,Base,Draft,"The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution. The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results."
Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer,Base,Incomplete,The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.,This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is incremented to a position after the buffer; or when pointer arithmetic results in a position after the buffer.
Incomplete Filtering of Special Elements,Base,Incomplete,"The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not completely filter special elements before sending it to a downstream component.",
Only Filtering Special Elements at a Specified Location,Base,Incomplete,"The product receives data from an upstream component, but only accounts for special elements at a specified location, thereby missing remaining special elements that may exist before sending it to a downstream component.","A filter might only account for instances of special elements when they occur: relative to a marker (e.g. at the beginning/end of string; the second argument), or at an absolute position (e.g. byte number 10). This may leave special elements in the data that did not match the filter position, but still may be dangerous."
Use of Hard-coded Credentials,Base,Draft,"The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.","Hard-coded credentials typically create a significant hole that allows an attacker to bypass the authentication that has been configured by the product administrator. This hole might be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Even if detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations: Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place. The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple."
Guessable CAPTCHA,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a CAPTCHA challenge, but the challenge can be guessed or automatically recognized by a non-human actor.","An automated attacker could bypass the intended protection of the CAPTCHA challenge and perform actions at a higher frequency than humanly possible, such as launching spam attacks. There can be several different causes of a guessable CAPTCHA: An audio or visual image that does not have sufficient distortion from the unobfuscated source image. A question is generated with a format that can be automatically recognized, such as a math question. A question for which the number of possible answers is limited, such as birth years or favorite sports teams. A general-knowledge or trivia question for which the answer can be accessed using a data base, such as country capitals or popular entertainers. Other data associated with the CAPTCHA may provide hints about its contents, such as an image whose filename contains the word that is used in the CAPTCHA."
Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.","When the length value exceeds the size of the destination, a buffer overflow could occur."
Missing Synchronization,Base,Incomplete,The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to synchronize access to the resource.,"If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource."
Incorrect Synchronization,Base,Incomplete,"The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner, but it does not correctly synchronize access to the resource.","If access to a shared resource is not correctly synchronized, then the resource may not be in a state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource."
Untrusted Pointer Dereference,Base,Incomplete,"The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.","An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location). There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to: The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call. In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between userland and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such example). Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment."
Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset,Base,Incomplete,"The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer.","While a pointer can contain a reference to any arbitrary memory location, a program typically only intends to use the pointer to access limited portions of memory, such as contiguous memory used to access an individual array. Programs may use offsets in order to access fields or sub-elements stored within structured data. The offset might be out-of-range if it comes from an untrusted source, is the result of an incorrect calculation, or occurs because of another error. If an attacker can control or influence the offset so that it points outside of the intended boundaries of the structure, then the attacker may be able to read or write to memory locations that are used elsewhere in the product. As a result, the attack might change the state of the product as accessed through program variables, cause a crash or instable behavior, and possibly lead to code execution."
Access of Uninitialized Pointer,Base,Incomplete,The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.,"If the pointer contains an uninitialized value, then the value might not point to a valid memory location. This could cause the product to read from or write to unexpected memory locations, leading to a denial of service. If the uninitialized pointer is used as a function call, then arbitrary functions could be invoked. If an attacker can influence the portion of uninitialized memory that is contained in the pointer, this weakness could be leveraged to execute code or perform other attacks. Depending on memory layout, associated memory management behaviors, and product operation, the attacker might be able to influence the contents of the uninitialized pointer, thus gaining more fine-grained control of the memory location to be accessed."
Expired Pointer Dereference,Base,Incomplete,"The product dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid, but is no longer valid.","When a product releases memory, but it maintains a pointer to that memory, then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data, then this could cause the product to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used, this could lead to a denial of service, information exposure, or code execution."
Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime,Base,Incomplete,The product releases a resource that is still intended to be used by itself or another actor.,"This weakness focuses on errors in which the product should not release a resource, but performs the release anyway. This is different than a weakness in which the product releases a resource at the appropriate time, but it maintains a reference to the resource, which it later accesses. For this weakness, the resource should still be valid upon the subsequent access. When a product releases a resource that is still being used, it is possible that operations will still be taken on this resource, which may have been repurposed in the meantime, leading to issues similar to CWE-825. Consequences may include denial of service, information exposure, or code execution."
Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe,Base,Incomplete,"The product defines a signal handler that contains code sequences that are not asynchronous-safe, i.e., the functionality is not reentrant, or it can be interrupted.","This can lead to an unexpected system state with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution. Signal handlers are typically intended to interrupt normal functionality of a program, or even other signals, in order to notify the process of an event. When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution. There are several different scenarios that introduce this issue: Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant. Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals. The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831). Note that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself. If both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return."
Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere,Base,Incomplete,"The product imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere.","When including third-party functionality, such as a web widget, library, or other source of functionality, the product must effectively trust that functionality. Without sufficient protection mechanisms, the functionality could be malicious in nature (either by coming from an untrusted source, being spoofed, or being modified in transit from a trusted source). The functionality might also contain its own weaknesses, or grant access to additional functionality and state information that should be kept private to the base system, such as system state information, sensitive application data, or the DOM of a web application. This might lead to many different consequences depending on the included functionality, but some examples include injection of malware, information exposure by granting excessive privileges or permissions to the untrusted functionality, DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, stealing user's cookies, or open redirect to malware (CWE-601)."
Signal Handler Function Associated with Multiple Signals,Base,Incomplete,The product defines a function that is used as a handler for more than one signal.,"While sometimes intentional and safe, when the same function is used to handle multiple signals, a race condition could occur if the function uses any state outside of its local declaration, such as global variables or non-reentrant functions, or has any side effects. An attacker could send one signal that invokes the handler function; in many OSes, this will typically prevent the same signal from invoking the handler again, at least until the handler function has completed execution. However, the attacker could then send a different signal that is associated with the same handler function. This could interrupt the original handler function while it is still executing. If there is shared state, then the state could be corrupted. This can lead to a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution. Another rarely-explored possibility arises when the signal handler is only designed to be executed once (if at all). By sending multiple signals, an attacker could invoke the function more than once. This may generate extra, unintended side effects. A race condition might not even be necessary; the attacker could send one signal, wait until it is handled, then send the other signal."
Unlock of a Resource that is not Locked,Base,Incomplete,The product attempts to unlock a resource that is not locked.,"Depending on the locking functionality, an unlock of a non-locked resource might cause memory corruption or other modification to the resource (or its associated metadata that is used for tracking locks)."
Deadlock,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.",
Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'),Base,Incomplete,"The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.","If the loop can be influenced by an attacker, this weakness could allow attackers to consume excessive resources such as CPU or memory."
Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication,Base,Incomplete,"The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.","Some authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password. As a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing."
"Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action",Base,Incomplete,"The product requires that an actor should only be able to perform an action once, or to have only one unique action, but the product does not enforce or improperly enforces this restriction.","In various applications, a user is only expected to perform a certain action once, such as voting, requesting a refund, or making a purchase. When this restriction is not enforced, sometimes this can have security implications. For example, in a voting application, an attacker could attempt to stuff the ballot box by voting multiple times. If these votes are counted separately, then the attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This could have significant business impact depending on the purpose of the product."
Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses or specifies an encoding when generating output to a downstream component, but the specified encoding is not the same as the encoding that is expected by the downstream component.","This weakness can cause the downstream component to use a decoding method that produces different data than what the product intended to send. When the wrong encoding is used - even if closely related - the downstream component could decode the data incorrectly. This can have security consequences when the provided boundaries between control and data are inadvertently broken, because the resulting data could introduce control characters or special elements that were not sent by the product. The resulting data could then be used to bypass protection mechanisms such as input validation, and enable injection attacks. While using output encoding is essential for ensuring that communications between components are accurate, the use of the wrong encoding - even if closely related - could cause the downstream component to misinterpret the output. For example, HTML entity encoding is used for elements in the HTML body of a web page. However, a programmer might use entity encoding when generating output for that is used within an attribute of an HTML tag, which could contain functional Javascript that is not affected by the HTML encoding. While web applications have received the most attention for this problem, this weakness could potentially apply to any type of product that uses a communications stream that could support multiple encodings."
Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check,Base,Incomplete,"The product checks a value to ensure that it is less than or equal to a maximum, but it does not also verify that the value is greater than or equal to the minimum.","Some products use signed integers or floats even when their values are only expected to be positive or 0. An input validation check might assume that the value is positive, and only check for the maximum value. If the value is negative, but the code assumes that the value is positive, this can produce an error. The error may have security consequences if the negative value is used for memory allocation, array access, buffer access, etc. Ultimately, the error could lead to a buffer overflow or other type of memory corruption. The use of a negative number in a positive-only context could have security implications for other types of resources. For example, a shopping cart might check that the user is not requesting more than 10 items, but a request for -3 items could cause the application to calculate a negative price and credit the attacker's account."
Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow,Base,Incomplete,"The product supports a session in which more than one behavior must be performed by an actor, but it does not properly ensure that the actor performs the behaviors in the required sequence.","By performing actions in an unexpected order, or by omitting steps, an attacker could manipulate the business logic of the product or cause it to enter an invalid state. In some cases, this can also expose resultant weaknesses. For example, a file-sharing protocol might require that an actor perform separate steps to provide a username, then a password, before being able to transfer files. If the file-sharing server accepts a password command followed by a transfer command, without any username being provided, the product might still perform the transfer. Note that this is different than CWE-696, which focuses on when the product performs actions in the wrong sequence; this entry is closely related, but it is focused on ensuring that the actor performs actions in the correct sequence. Workflow-related behaviors include: Steps are performed in the expected order. Required steps are not omitted. Steps are not interrupted. Steps are performed in a timely fashion."
Placement of User into Incorrect Group,Base,Incomplete,The product or the administrator places a user into an incorrect group.,"If the incorrect group has more access or privileges than the intended group, the user might be able to bypass intended security policy to access unexpected resources or perform unexpected actions. The access-control system might not be able to detect malicious usage of this group membership."
Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion'),Base,Incomplete,"The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.","When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways. This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues."
Use of Uninitialized Resource,Base,Incomplete,The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.,"When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product."
Missing Initialization of Resource,Base,Incomplete,The product does not initialize a critical resource.,"Many resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values."
Use of Expired File Descriptor,Base,Incomplete,The product uses or accesses a file descriptor after it has been closed.,"After a file descriptor for a particular file or device has been released, it can be reused. The code might not write to the original file, since the reused file descriptor might reference a different file or device."
Improper Update of Reference Count,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count.","Reference counts can be used when tracking how many objects contain a reference to a particular resource, such as in memory management or garbage collection. When the reference count reaches zero, the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero, then the resource might be released too soon, even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource, but the reference count is not zero, then the resource might not ever be released."
Improper Control of Dynamically-Identified Variables,Base,Incomplete,The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-identified variables.,"Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to access arbitrary variables that are specified by an input string. While these features can offer significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can be extremely dangerous if attackers can modify unintended variables that have security implications."
Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes,Base,Incomplete,"The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies multiple attributes, properties, or fields that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control which attributes can be modified.","If the object contains attributes that were only intended for internal use, then their unexpected modification could lead to a vulnerability. This weakness is sometimes known by the language-specific mechanisms that make it possible, such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection."
Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort,Base,Incomplete,"The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.","Many password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash. Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker. There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack: The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (stretching) The amount of memory required to compute the hash (memory-hard operations) Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (salting) Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (one-way hashing) Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (collision resistance) Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack."
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection'),Base,Incomplete,"The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.","Frameworks such as Java Server Page (JSP) allow a developer to insert executable expressions within otherwise-static content. When the developer is not aware of the executable nature of these expressions and/or does not disable them, then if an attacker can inject expressions, this could lead to code execution or other unexpected behaviors."
Improper Restriction of Power Consumption,Base,Incomplete,"The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be automatically replenished, but the product does not properly restrict the amount of power that its operation consumes.","In environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished by the product itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the product uses too much power too quickly, then this could cause the device (and subsequently, the product) to stop functioning until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner because of increased power costs. Normal operation of an application will consume power. However, in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume more power than intended, using components such as: Display CPU Disk I/O GPS Sound Microphone USB interface"
Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control,Base,Incomplete,The product stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have built-in access control.,"While many modern file systems or devices utilize some form of access control in order to restrict access to data, not all storage mechanisms have this capability. For example, memory cards, floppy disks, CDs, and USB devices are typically made accessible to any user within the system. This can become a problem when sensitive data is stored in these mechanisms in a multi-user environment, because anybody on the system can read or write this data. On Android devices, external storage is typically globally readable and writable by other applications on the device. External storage may also be easily accessible through the mobile device's USB connection or physically accessible through the device's memory card port."
Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,"The product establishes a communication channel with an endpoint and receives a message from that endpoint, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the message was not modified during transmission.",Attackers might be able to modify the message and spoof the endpoint by interfering with the data as it crosses the network or by redirecting the connection to a system under their control.
Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a handler for a custom URL scheme, but it does not properly restrict which actors can invoke the handler using the scheme.","Mobile platforms and other architectures allow the use of custom URL schemes to facilitate communication between applications. In the case of iOS, this is the only method to do inter-application communication. The implementation is at the developer's discretion which may open security flaws in the application. An example could be potentially dangerous functionality such as modifying files through a custom URL scheme."
Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,"The product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor, but it does not properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.","When an attacker can successfully establish a communication channel from an untrusted origin, the attacker may be able to gain privileges and access unexpected functionality."
Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel,Base,Incomplete,"The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.","Attackers at the destination may be able to spoof trusted servers to steal data or cause a denial of service. There are at least two distinct weaknesses that can cause the product to communicate with an unintended destination: If the product allows an attacker to control which destination is specified, then the attacker can cause it to connect to an untrusted or malicious destination. For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions. If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a sticky broadcast to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application."
Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User,Base,Incomplete,"The product displays information or identifiers to a user, but the display mechanism does not make it easy for the user to distinguish between visually similar or identical glyphs (homoglyphs), which may cause the user to misinterpret a glyph and perform an unintended, insecure action.","Some glyphs, pictures, or icons can be semantically distinct to a program, while appearing very similar or identical to a human user. These are referred to as homoglyphs. For example, the lowercase l (ell) and uppercase I (eye) have different character codes, but these characters can be displayed in exactly the same way to a user, depending on the font. This can also occur between different character sets. For example, the Latin capital letter A and the Greek capital letter Α (Alpha) are treated as distinct by programs, but may be displayed in exactly the same way to a user. Accent marks may also cause letters to appear very similar, such as the Latin capital letter grave mark À and its equivalent Á with the acute accent. Adversaries can exploit this visual similarity for attacks such as phishing, e.g. by providing a link to an attacker-controlled hostname that looks like a hostname that the victim trusts. In a different use of homoglyphs, an adversary may create a back door username that is visually similar to the username of a regular user, which then makes it more difficult for a system administrator to detect the malicious username while reviewing logs."
Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames,Base,Incomplete,"The web application does not restrict or incorrectly restricts frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, which can lead to user confusion about which interface the user is interacting with.","A web application is expected to place restrictions on whether it is allowed to be rendered within frames, iframes, objects, embed or applet elements. Without the restrictions, users can be tricked into interacting with the application when they were not intending to."
Comparison of Incompatible Types,Base,Incomplete,"The product performs a comparison between two entities, but the entities are of different, incompatible types that cannot be guaranteed to provide correct results when they are directly compared.","In languages that are strictly typed but support casting/conversion, such as C or C++, the programmer might assume that casting one entity to the same type as another entity will ensure that the comparison will be performed correctly, but this cannot be guaranteed. In languages that are not strictly typed, such as PHP or JavaScript, there may be implicit casting/conversion to a type that the programmer is unaware of, causing unexpected results; for example, the string 123 might be converted to a number type. See examples."
Comparison Using Wrong Factors,Base,Incomplete,"The code performs a comparison between two entities, but the comparison examines the wrong factors or characteristics of the entities, which can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses.","This can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses. For example, the code might inadvertently compare references to objects, instead of the relevant contents of those objects, causing two equal objects to be considered unequal."
Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code,Base,Incomplete,"The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the processor optimizes the execution of the program such that the mechanism is removed or modified.",
Use of Redundant Code,Base,Incomplete,"The product has multiple functions, methods, procedures, macros, etc. that contain the same code.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. For example, if there are two copies of the same code, the programmer might fix a weakness in one copy while forgetting to fix the same weakness in another copy."
Data Element Aggregating an Excessively Large Number of Non-Primitive Elements,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a data element that has an excessively large number of sub-elements with non-primitive data types such as structures or aggregated objects.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of excessively large may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 sub-elements."
Architecture with Number of Horizontal Layers Outside of Expected Range,Base,Incomplete,The product's architecture contains too many - or too few - horizontal layers.,"This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the interpretation of expected range may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default minimum of 4 layers and maximum of 8 layers."
Parent Class with a Virtual Destructor and a Child Class without a Virtual Destructor,Variant,Incomplete,"A parent class has a virtual destructor method, but the parent has a child class that does not have a virtual destructor.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, since the child might not perform essential destruction operations. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability, such as a memory leak (CWE-401)."
Creation of Immutable Text Using String Concatenation,Base,Incomplete,The product creates an immutable text string using string concatenation operations.,"When building a string via a looping feature (e.g., a FOR or WHILE loop), the use of += to append to the existing string will result in the creation of a new object with each iteration. This programming pattern can be inefficient in comparison with use of text buffer data elements. This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this could be influenced to create performance problem."
Modules with Circular Dependencies,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains modules in which one module has references that cycle back to itself, i.e., there are circular dependencies.","As an example, with Java, this weakness might indicate cycles between packages. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to insufficient modularity, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Invokable Control Element with Large Number of Outward Calls,Base,Incomplete,"The code contains callable control elements that contain an excessively large number of references to other application objects external to the context of the callable, i.e. a Fan-Out value that is excessively large.","While the interpretation of excessively large Fan-Out value may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Excessive Data Query Operations in a Large Data Table,Base,Incomplete,The product performs a data query with a large number of joins and sub-queries on a large data table.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of large data table and large number of joins or sub-queries may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 1 million rows for a large data table, a default minimum of 5 joins, and a default minimum of 3 sub-queries."
Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop,Base,Incomplete,"The product has a loop body or loop condition that contains a control element that directly or indirectly consumes platform resources, e.g. messaging, sessions, locks, or file descriptors.","This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If an attacker can influence the number of iterations in the loop, then this performance problem might allow a denial of service by consuming more platform resources than intended."
Initialization with Hard-Coded Network Resource Configuration Data,Base,Incomplete,The product initializes data using hard-coded values that act as network resource identifiers.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. if it runs in an environment does not use the hard-coded network resource identifiers. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Excessive Use of Hard-Coded Literals in Initialization,Base,Incomplete,The product initializes a data element using a hard-coded literal that is not a simple integer or static constant element.,"This issue makes it more difficult to modify or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Missing Documentation for Design,Base,Incomplete,The product does not have documentation that represents how it is designed.,This issue can make it more difficult to understand and maintain the product. It can make it more difficult and time-consuming to detect and/or fix vulnerabilities.
Invocation of a Control Element at an Unnecessarily Deep Horizontal Layer,Base,Incomplete,"The code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides at a deeper layer than the adjacent layer, i.e., the invocation skips at least one layer, and the invoked code is not part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer.","This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Multiple Inheritance from Concrete Classes,Base,Incomplete,The product contains a class with inheritance from more than one concrete class.,"This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Invokable Control Element with Variadic Parameters,Base,Incomplete,A named-callable or method control element has a signature that supports a variable (variadic) number of parameters or arguments.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability. With variadic arguments, it can be difficult or inefficient for manual analysis to be certain of which function/method is being invoked."
Data Access Operations Outside of Expected Data Manager Component,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses a dedicated, central data manager component as required by design, but it contains code that performs data-access operations that do not use this data manager.","This issue can make the product perform more slowly than intended, since the intended central data manager may have been explicitly optimized for performance or other quality characteristics. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Invokable Control Element in Multi-Thread Context with non-Final Static Storable or Member Element,Base,Incomplete,The code contains a function or method that operates in a multi-threaded environment but owns an unsafe non-final static storable or member data element.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses,Base,Incomplete,The product performs too many data queries without using efficient data processing functionality such as stored procedures.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of too many data queries may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient function/procedure."
Parent Class with References to Child Class,Base,Incomplete,"The code has a parent class that contains references to a child class, its methods, or its members.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Creation of Class Instance within a Static Code Block,Base,Incomplete,A static code block creates an instance of a class.,"This pattern identifies situations where a storable data element or member data element is initialized with a value in a block of code which is declared as static. This issue can make the product perform more slowly by performing initialization before it is needed. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Invokable Control Element with Signature Containing an Excessive Number of Parameters,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains a function, subroutine, or method whose signature has an unnecessarily large number of parameters/arguments.","This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the interpretation of large number of parameters. may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 7 parameters/arguments."
Runtime Resource Management Control Element in a Component Built to Run on Application Servers,Base,Incomplete,"The product uses deployed components from application servers, but it also uses low-level functions/methods for management of resources, instead of the API provided by the application server.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Missing Serialization Control Element,Base,Incomplete,The product contains a serializable data element that does not have an associated serialization method.,"This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by triggering an exception. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability. As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java."
Excessive Execution of Sequential Searches of Data Resource,Base,Incomplete,The product contains a data query against an SQL table or view that is configured in a way that does not utilize an index and may cause sequential searches to be performed.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Inconsistency Between Implementation and Documented Design,Base,Incomplete,The implementation of the product is not consistent with the design as described within the relevant documentation.,"This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to inconsistencies, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Empty Exception Block,Base,Incomplete,"An invokable code block contains an exception handling block that does not contain any code, i.e. is empty.","When an exception handling block (such as a Catch and Finally block) is used, but that block is empty, this can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Serializable Data Element Containing non-Serializable Item Elements,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains a serializable, storable data element such as a field or member, but the data element contains member elements that are not serializable.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability. As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable interface in Java."
Empty Code Block,Base,Incomplete,"The source code contains a block that does not contain any code, i.e., the block is empty.","Empty code blocks can occur in the bodies of conditionals, function or method definitions, exception handlers, etc. While an empty code block might be intentional, it might also indicate incomplete implementation, accidental code deletion, unexpected macro expansion, etc. For some programming languages and constructs, an empty block might be allowed by the syntax, but the lack of any behavior within the block might violate a convention or API in such a way that it is an error."
Data Resource Access without Use of Connection Pooling,Base,Incomplete,The product accesses a data resource through a database without using a connection pooling capability.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly, as connection pools allow connections to be reused without the overhead and time consumption of opening and closing a new connection. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Non-SQL Invokable Control Element with Excessive Number of Data Resource Accesses,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains a client with a function or method that contains a large number of data accesses/queries that are sent through a data manager, i.e., does not use efficient database capabilities.","This issue can make the product perform more slowly.

It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Floating Point Comparison with Incorrect Operator,Variant,Incomplete,"The code performs a comparison such as an equality test between two float (floating point) values, but it uses comparison operators that do not account for the possibility of loss of precision.","Numeric calculation using floating point values can generate imprecise results because of rounding errors. As a result, two different calculations might generate numbers that are mathematically equal, but have slightly different bit representations that do not translate to the same mathematically-equal values. As a result, an equality test or other comparison might produce unexpected results. This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."

Data Access from Outside Expected Data Manager Component,Base,Incomplete,"The product is intended to manage data access through a particular data manager component such as a relational or non-SQL database, but it contains code that performs data access operations without using that component.","When the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all data access operations through that component. If a data access operation is performed outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended design. This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."

While the interpretation of large number of children may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 10 child classes."
Class with Virtual Method without a Virtual Destructor,Base,Incomplete,"A class contains a virtual method, but the method does not have an associated virtual destructor.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. due to undefined behavior. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Synchronous Access of Remote Resource without Timeout,Base,Incomplete,"The code has a synchronous call to a remote resource, but there is no timeout for the call, or the timeout is set to infinite.","This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, since an outage for the remote resource can cause the product to hang. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability."
Large Data Table with Excessive Number of Indices,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a large data table that contains an excessively large number of indices.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Method Containing Access of a Member Element from Another Class,Base,Incomplete,A method for a class performs an operation that directly accesses a member element from another class.,"This issue suggests poor encapsulation and makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Use of Object without Invoking Destructor Method,Base,Incomplete,The product contains a method that accesses an object but does not later invoke the element's associated finalize/destructor method.,"This issue can make the product perform more slowly by retaining memory and/or other resources longer than necessary.

It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Excessive Index Range Scan for a Data Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product contains an index range scan for a large data table, but the scan can cover a large number of rows.","This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the interpretation of large data table and excessive index range may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the index range."

It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Persistent Storable Data Element without Associated Comparison Control Element,Base,Incomplete,The product uses a storable data element that does not have all of the associated functions or methods that are necessary to support comparison.,"For example, with Java, a class that is made persistent requires both hashCode() and equals() methods to be defined. This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, due to incorrect or unexpected comparison results.

Use of Platform-Dependent Third Party Components,Base,Incomplete,The product relies on third-party components that do not provide equivalent functionality across all desirable platforms.,"This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components,Base,Incomplete,The product relies on third-party components that are not actively supported or maintained by the original developer or a trusted proxy for the original developer.,"Reliance on components that are no longer maintained can make it difficult or impossible to fix significant bugs, vulnerabilities, or quality issues. In effect, unmaintained code can become obsolete. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Insufficient Encapsulation of Machine-Dependent Functionality,Base,Incomplete,"The product or code uses machine-dependent functionality, but it does not sufficiently encapsulate or isolate this functionality from the rest of the code.","This issue makes it more difficult to port or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.

Insufficient Use of Symbolic Constants,Base,Incomplete,"The source code uses literal constants that may need to change or evolve over time, instead of using symbolic constants.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Insufficient Isolation of Symbolic Constant Definitions,Base,Incomplete,"The source code uses symbolic constants, but it does not sufficiently place the definitions of these constants into a more centralized or isolated location.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Excessive Reliance on Global Variables,Base,Incomplete,"The code is structured in a way that relies too much on using or setting global variables throughout various points in the code, instead of preserving the associated information in a narrower, more local context.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Use of Same Variable for Multiple Purposes,Base,Incomplete,"The code contains a callable, block, or other code element in which the same variable is used to control more than one unique task or store more than one instance of data.","Use of the same variable for multiple purposes can make it more difficult for a person to read or understand the code, potentially hiding other quality issues. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."

It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Source Code Element without Standard Prologue,Base,Incomplete,The source code contains elements such as source files that do not consistently provide a prologue or header that has been standardized for the project.,"The lack of a prologue can make it more difficult to accurately and quickly understand the associated code. Standard prologues or headers may contain information such as module name, version number, author, date, purpose, function, assumptions, limitations, accuracy considerations, etc. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to insufficient analyzability, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Inaccurate Comments,Base,Incomplete,The source code contains comments that do not accurately describe or explain aspects of the portion of the code with which the comment is associated.,"When a comment does not accurately reflect the associated code elements, this can introduce confusion to a reviewer (due to inconsistencies) or make it more difficult and less efficient to validate that the code is implementing the intended behavior correctly. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Callable with Insufficient Behavioral Summary,Base,Incomplete,"The code contains a function or method whose signature and/or associated inline documentation does not sufficiently describe the callable's inputs, outputs, side effects, assumptions, or return codes.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Insufficient Documentation of Error Handling Techniques,Base,Incomplete,"The documentation does not sufficiently describe the techniques that are used for error handling, exception processing, or similar mechanisms.","Documentation may need to cover error handling techniques at multiple layers, such as module, executable, compilable code unit, or callable."
Excessive Use of Unconditional Branching,Base,Incomplete,The code uses too many unconditional branches (such as goto).,"This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Excessive McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity,Base,Incomplete,The code contains McCabe cyclomatic complexity that exceeds a desirable maximum.,"This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."

It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Excessive Attack Surface,Base,Incomplete,The product has an attack surface whose quantitative measurement exceeds a desirable maximum.,"Originating from software security, an attack surface measure typically reflects the number of input points and output points that can be utilized by an untrusted party, i.e. a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses. In some cases, this measure may reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage."
Declaration of Variable with Unnecessarily Wide Scope,Base,Incomplete,"The source code declares a variable in one scope, but the variable is only used within a narrower scope.","This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Compilation with Insufficient Warnings or Errors,Base,Incomplete,"The code is compiled without sufficient warnings enabled, which may prevent the detection of subtle bugs or quality issues.","This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities."
Improper Use of Validation Framework,Base,Draft,"The product does not use, or incorrectly uses, an input validation framework that is provided by the source language or an independent library.","Many modern coding languages provide developers with input validation frameworks to make the task of input validation easier and less error-prone. These frameworks will automatically check all input against specified criteria and direct execution to error handlers when invalid input is received. The improper use (i.e., an incorrect implementation or missing altogether) of these frameworks is not directly exploitable, but can lead to an exploitable condition if proper input validation is not performed later in the product. Not using provided input validation frameworks can also hurt the maintainability of code as future developers may not recognize the downstream input validation being used in the place of the validation framework."
Insecure Default Initialization of Resource,Base,Incomplete,"The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.","Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it."
Insufficient Granularity of Access Control,Base,Incomplete,"The product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.","Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection. A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration."
Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata,Base,Incomplete,"The product prevents direct access to a resource containing sensitive information, but it does not sufficiently limit access to metadata that is derived from the original, sensitive information.","Developers might correctly prevent unauthorized access to a database or other resource containing sensitive information, but they might not consider that portions of the original information might also be recorded in metadata, search indices, statistical reports, or other resources. If these resources are not also restricted, then attackers might be able to extract some or all of the original information, or otherwise infer some details. For example, an attacker could specify search terms that are known to be unique to a particular person, or view metadata such as activity or creation dates in order to identify usage patterns."
Incorrect Use of Autoboxing and Unboxing for Performance Critical Operations,Base,Incomplete,"The code uses boxed primitives, which may introduce inefficiencies into performance-critical operations.","Languages such as Java and C# support automatic conversion through their respective compilers from primitive types into objects of the corresponding wrapper classes, and vice versa. For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner. However, this feature comes at a cost of performance and can lead to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with generic collections. Therefore, they should not be used for scientific computing or other performance critical operations. They are only suited to support impedance mismatch between reference types and primitives."
Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File,Base,Incomplete,"The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.","User-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel, Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which, when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software."
Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation,Base,Draft,"To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.","Cryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of primitive can vary depending on point of view. See Terminology Notes for further explanation of some concepts. Cryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time. If a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is broken). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack. Cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly. If ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences. This weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used."
Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator,Base,Draft,The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.,
Unintended Reentrant Invocation of Non-reentrant Code Via Nested Calls,Base,Draft,"During execution of non-reentrant code, the product performs a call that unintentionally produces a nested invocation of the non-reentrant code.","In a complex product, a single function call may lead to many different possible code paths, some of which may involve deeply nested calls. It may be difficult to foresee all possible code paths that could emanate from a given function call. In some systems, an external actor can manipulate inputs to the system and thereby achieve a wide range of possible control flows. This is frequently a concern in products that execute scripts from untrusted sources. Examples of such products are web browsers and PDF readers. A weakness is present when one of the possible code paths resulting from a function call alters program state that the original caller assumes to be unchanged during the call."
Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number,Base,Draft,"The product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.","When a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. There are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as Π or √2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math."
Incorrect Parsing of Numbers with Different Radices,Base,Incomplete,"The product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).","Frequently, a numeric input that begins with 0 is treated as octal, or 0x causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function. For example, 023 (octal) is 35 decimal, or 0x31 is 49 decimal. Other bases may be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a 0127.0.0.1 IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading 0, whose numeric value would be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use 127.0.0.1. The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing of SSRF restrictions."
