The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.","CONFIRM:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-399.html   |   DEBIAN:DSA-5117   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-64b2c02d29   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6ETPM2OVZZ6KOS2L7QO7SIW6XWT5OW3F/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-dfbf7e2372   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UHFSRVLM2JUCPDC2KGB7ETPQYJLCGBLD/   |   MISC:https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-399.txt   |   URL:https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-399.txt   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20220405 Xen Security Advisory 399 v2 (CVE-2022-26357) - race in VT-d domain ID cleanup   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/05/2",Assigned (20220302),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
