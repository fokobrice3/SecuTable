CVE-2021-22696,Candidate,"CXF supports (via JwtRequestCodeFilter) passing OAuth 2 parameters via a JWT token as opposed to query parameters (see: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR)). Instead of sending a JWT token as a ""request"" parameter, the spec also supports specifying a URI from which to retrieve a JWT token from via the ""request_uri"" parameter. CXF was not validating the ""request_uri"" parameter (apart from ensuring it uses ""https) and was making a REST request to the parameter in the request to retrieve a token. This means that CXF was vulnerable to DDos attacks on the authorization server, as specified in section 10.4.1 of the spec. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.3; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.10.","MISC:https://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2021-22696.txt.asc   |   URL:https://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2021-22696.txt.asc   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html   |   MLIST:[announce] 20210402 [Apache CXF] CVE-2021-22696: OAuth 2 authorization service vulnerable to DDos attacks   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r6445001cc5f9a2bb1e6316993753306e054bdd1d702656b7cbe59045@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[cxf-commits] 20210402 svn commit: r1073270 - in /websites/production/cxf/content: cache/main.pageCache security-advisories.data/CVE-2021-22696.txt.asc security-advisories.html   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rec7160382badd3ef4ad017a22f64a266c7188b9ba71394f0d321e2d4@%3Ccommits.cxf.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[cxf-commits] 20210616 svn commit: r1075801 - in /websites/production/cxf/content: cache/main.pageCache index.html security-advisories.data/CVE-2021-30468.txt.asc security-advisories.html   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb87e0bf3995e7d560afeed750fac9329ff5f1ad49da365129b7f89e@%3Ccommits.cxf.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[cxf-dev] 20210402 CVE-2021-22696: OAuth 2 authorization service vulnerable to DDos attacks   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8651c06212c56294a1c0ea61a5ad7790c06502209c03f05c0c7c9914@%3Cdev.cxf.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[cxf-users] 20210402 CVE-2021-22696: OAuth 2 authorization service vulnerable to DDos attacks   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8651c06212c56294a1c0ea61a5ad7790c06502209c03f05c0c7c9914@%3Cusers.cxf.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20210402 CVE-2021-22696: Apache CXF: OAuth 2 authorization service vulnerable to DDos attacks   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/02/2",Assigned (20210106),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
