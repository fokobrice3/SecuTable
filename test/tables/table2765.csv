CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2017-15113,LOW,ovirt-engine before version 4.1.7.6 with log level set to DEBUG includes passwords in the log file without masking. Only administrators can change the log level and only administrators can access the logs. This presents a risk when debug-level logs are shared with vendors or other parties to troubleshoot issues.
CVE-2017-15114,HIGH,"When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes."
CVE-2017-15115,HIGH,"The sctp_do_peeloff function in net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14 does not check whether the intended netns is used in a peel-off action, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls."
CVE-2017-15116,MEDIUM,The rngapi_reset function in crypto/rng.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).
CVE-2017-15117,Unknown,** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: none.  Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA.  Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue.  Notes: none.
CVE-2017-15118,HIGH,"A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in NBD server implementation in qemu before 2.11 allowing a client to request an export name of size up to 4096 bytes, which in fact should be limited to 256 bytes, causing an out-of-bounds stack write in the qemu process. If NBD server requires TLS, the attacker cannot trigger the buffer overflow without first successfully negotiating TLS."
CVE-2017-15119,MEDIUM,"The Network Block Device (NBD) server in Quick Emulator (QEMU) before 2.11 is vulnerable to a denial of service issue. It could occur if a client sent large option requests, making the server waste CPU time on reading up to 4GB per request. A client could use this flaw to keep the NBD server from serving other requests, resulting in DoS."
CVE-2017-15120,MEDIUM,"An issue has been found in the parsing of authoritative answers in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.0.8, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when parsing a specially crafted answer containing a CNAME of a different class than IN. An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause a denial of service."
CVE-2017-15121,MEDIUM,A non-privileged user is able to mount a fuse filesystem on RHEL 6 or 7 and crash a system if an application punches a hole in a file that does not end aligned to a page boundary.
CVE-2017-15123,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in the CloudForms web interface, versions 5.8 - 5.10, where the RSS feed URLs are not properly restricted to authenticated users only. An attacker could use this flaw to view potentially sensitive information from CloudForms including data such as newly created virtual machines."
CVE-2017-15124,HIGH,"VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older was found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host."
CVE-2017-15125,LOW,A flaw was found in CloudForms before 5.9.0.22 in the self-service UI snapshot feature where the name field is not properly sanitized for HTML and JavaScript input. An attacker could use this flaw to execute a stored XSS attack on an application administrator using CloudForms. Please note that CSP (Content Security Policy) prevents exploitation of this XSS however not all browsers support CSP.
CVE-2017-15126,HIGH,A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/userfaultfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.6. The issue is related to the handling of fork failure when dealing with event messages. Failure to fork correctly can lead to a situation where a fork event will be removed from an already freed list of events with userfaultfd_ctx_put().
CVE-2017-15127,MEDIUM,A flaw was found in the hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte function in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. A superfluous implicit page unlock for VM_SHARED hugetlbfs mapping could trigger a local denial of service (BUG).
CVE-2017-15128,MEDIUM,A flaw was found in the hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte function in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.12. A lack of size check could cause a denial of service (BUG).
CVE-2017-15129,MEDIUM,"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces code affecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. The function get_net_ns_by_id() in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr, which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely."
CVE-2017-15130,MEDIUM,"A denial of service flaw was found in dovecot before 2.2.34. An attacker able to generate random SNI server names could exploit TLS SNI configuration lookups, leading to excessive memory usage and the process to restart."
CVE-2017-15131,MEDIUM,"It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before setting umask policy. This only affects xdg-user-dirs before 0.15.5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux."
CVE-2017-15132,MEDIUM,A flaw was found in dovecot 2.0 up to 2.2.33 and 2.3.0. An abort of SASL authentication results in a memory leak in dovecot's auth client used by login processes. The leak has impact in high performance configuration where same login processes are reused and can cause the process to crash due to memory exhaustion.
CVE-2017-15133,MEDIUM,A denial of service flaw was found in miekg-dns before 1.0.4. A remote attacker could use carefully timed TCP packets to block the DNS server from accepting new connections.
CVE-2017-15134,MEDIUM,"A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base 1.3.6.x before 1.3.6.13, 1.3.7.x before 1.3.7.9, 1.4.x before 1.4.0.5 handled certain LDAP search filters. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP request, thus resulting in denial of service."
CVE-2017-15135,MEDIUM,"It was found that 389-ds-base since 1.3.6.1 up to and including 1.4.0.3 did not always handle internal hash comparison operations correctly during the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass the authentication process under very rare and specific circumstances."
CVE-2017-15136,MEDIUM,When registering and activating a new system with Red Hat Satellite 6 if the new systems hostname is then reset to the hostname of a previously registered system the previously registered system will lose access to updates including security updates.
CVE-2017-15137,MEDIUM,"The OpenShift image import whitelist failed to enforce restrictions correctly when running commands such as ""oc tag"", for example. This could allow a user with access to OpenShift to run images from registries that should not be allowed."
CVE-2017-15138,MEDIUM,The OpenShift Enterprise cluster-read can access webhook tokens which would allow an attacker with sufficient privileges to view confidential webhook tokens.
CVE-2017-15139,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability was found in openstack-cinder releases up to and including Queens, allowing newly created volumes in certain storage volume configurations to contain previous data. It specifically affects ScaleIO volumes using thin volumes and zero padding. This could lead to leakage of sensitive information between tenants."
