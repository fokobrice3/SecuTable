CVE-2022-24666,Candidate,"A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 frame. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS frame where the frame contains priority information without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame with HTTP/2 priority information does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability is high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately crafted frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2 is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe. However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz.","MISC:https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-ccw9-q5h2-8c2w   |   URL:https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/security/advisories/GHSA-ccw9-q5h2-8c2w",Assigned (20220207),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2022-24667,Candidate,"A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HPACK-encoded header block. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. There are a number of implementation errors in the parsing of HPACK-encoded header blocks that allow maliciously crafted HPACK header blocks to cause crashes in processes using swift-nio-http2. Each of these crashes is triggered instead of an integer overflow. A malicious HPACK header block could be sent on any of the HPACK-carrying frames in a HTTP/2 connection (HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE), at any position. Sending a HPACK header block does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send one. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to send an appropriately crafted field block.

CVE-2022-24668,Candidate,"A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused by a network peer sending ALTSVC or ORIGIN frames. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error after frame parsing but before frame handling. ORIGIN and ALTSVC frames are not currently supported by swift-nio-http2, and should be ignored. However, one code path that encounters them has a deliberate trap instead. This was left behind from the original development process and was never removed. Sending an ALTSVC or ORIGIN frame does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an attack.

CVE-2022-24713,Candidate,"regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language.

Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability.
