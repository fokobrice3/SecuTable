CVE-2022-23506,Candidate,"Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds. This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally, credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and `/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs. setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs. Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of those credentials.","MISC:https://github.com/spinnaker/rosco/commit/e80cfaa1abfb3a0e9026d45d6027291bfb815daf   |   URL:https://github.com/spinnaker/rosco/commit/e80cfaa1abfb3a0e9026d45d6027291bfb815daf   |   MISC:https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/security/advisories/GHSA-2233-cqj8-j2q5   |   URL:https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/security/advisories/GHSA-2233-cqj8-j2q5",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-23508,Candidate,"Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise. A vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources. GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to block unauthorized access, therefore allowing local users (and processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content. By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target Kubernetes cluster.

Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and 9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include either an external URL to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or use the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file containing JavaScript.

CVE-2022-23555,Candidate,"authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.","MISC:https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-9qwp-jf7p-vr7h   |   URL:https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-9qwp-jf7p-vr7h",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-23563,Candidate,"Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness).

CVE-2022-23600,Candidate,"fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery.

CVE-2022-23610,Candidate,"wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release, it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML, but without SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by an attacker, an upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO enabled. If SCIM was not enabled, the attacker could also create new users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app), the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive, but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick).

CVE-2022-23612,Candidate,"OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focusing on giving providers a free customizable electronic medical record system. Affected versions are subject to arbitrary file exfiltration due to failure to sanitize request when satisfying GET requests for `/images` & `/initfilter/scripts`. This can allow an attacker to access any file on a system running OpenMRS that is accessible to the user id OpenMRS is running under. Affected implementations should update to the latest patch version of OpenMRS Core for the minor version they use. These are: 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5 and 2.5.3. As a general rule, this vulnerability is already mitigated by Tomcat's URL normalization in Tomcat 7.0.28+. Users on older versions of Tomcat should consider upgrading their Tomcat instance as well as their OpenMRS instance.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/security/advisories/GHSA-8rgr-ww69-jv65   |   URL:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/security/advisories/GHSA-8rgr-ww69-jv65   |   MISC:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/ee3373a7a775bfdfa263e2e912c72e64342fb4f0/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123   |   URL:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/ee3373a7a775bfdfa263e2e912c72e64342fb4f0/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123   |   MISC:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/db8454bf19a092a78d53ee4dba2af628b730a6e7#diff-7c64d9f61d4d4e2ddba92920d7cf63ec96091b308d43904956b3846bc0c26d80R128   |   URL:https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/commit/db8454bf19a092a78d53ee4dba2af628b730a6e7#diff-7c64d9f61d4d4e2ddba92920d7cf63ec96091b308d43904956b3846bc0c26d80R128   |   MISC:https://lgtm.com/projects/g/openmrs/openmrs-core/snapshot/fb1335c925ca4c94be5a546707b90d2c1efa4dcc/files/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123   |   URL:https://lgtm.com/projects/g/openmrs/openmrs-core/snapshot/fb1335c925ca4c94be5a546707b90d2c1efa4dcc/files/web/src/main/java/org/openmrs/web/filter/StartupFilter.java#L123",Assigned (20220119),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
