CVE-2021-21367,Candidate,"Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).","CONFIRM:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/security/advisories/GHSA-5p3g-j69g-w2mq   |   URL:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/security/advisories/GHSA-5p3g-j69g-w2mq   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-3dedd41a06   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O7TCGM4B45VLUJDCE5PHFYA5KBNHD4RA/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-6210be0100   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SWUPPVFG76PXQA3AHSGKYPRMVZ5AYHZI/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-7d55c00267   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AV7WKO5SZHTF3QEMX4WZ576HRECIG6VQ/   |   MISC:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/commit/86500e645a907538abafe5225b67cc12c03e7645   |   URL:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/commit/86500e645a907538abafe5225b67cc12c03e7645   |   MISC:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/releases/tag/2.3.5   |   URL:https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/releases/tag/2.3.5",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-21368,Candidate,"msgpack5 is a msgpack v5 implementation for node.js and the browser. In msgpack5 before versions 3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1 there is a ""Prototype Poisoning"" vulnerability. When msgpack5 decodes a map containing a key ""__proto__"", it assigns the decoded value to __proto__. Object.prototype.__proto__ is an accessor property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to the key __proto__ decodes to an object or null, msgpack5 sets the decoded object's prototype to that value. An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example length, numeric properties, and push et al if __proto__'s value decodes to an Array); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for example if the __proto__ value decodes to a Map or Date). Other unexpected behavior might be produced for other types. There is no effect on the global prototype. This ""prototype poisoning"" is sort of a very limited inversion of a prototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is affected, and it can only be set to msgpack5 values (though if the victim makes use of custom codecs, anything could be a msgpack5 value). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype pollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code). This has been fixed in msgpack5 version 3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1.

CVE-2021-21378,Candidate,"Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-4996-m8hf-hj27   |   URL:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-4996-m8hf-hj27   |   MISC:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/ea39e3cba652bcc4b11bb0d5c62b017e584d2e5a   |   URL:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/ea39e3cba652bcc4b11bb0d5c62b017e584d2e5a   |   MISC:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/15194   |   URL:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/15194",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running.

This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: ""serialized"", and ""compressed"", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/security/advisories/GHSA-4g52-pqcj-phvh   |   URL:https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/security/advisories/GHSA-4g52-pqcj-phvh   |   MISC:https://gist.github.com/wadeAlexC/2490d522e81a796af9efcad1686e6754   |   URL:https://gist.github.com/wadeAlexC/2490d522e81a796af9efcad1686e6754   |   MISC:https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393   |   URL:https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-21411,Candidate,"OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm   |   URL:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-652x-m2gr-hppm   |   MISC:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/   |   URL:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/   |   MISC:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/0279fa7dff1752f1710707dbd1ffac839de8bbfc   |   URL:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/0279fa7dff1752f1710707dbd1ffac839de8bbfc   |   MISC:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/v7.1.0   |   URL:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/v7.1.0   |   MISC:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7   |   URL:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-21413,Candidate,"isolated-vm is a library for nodejs which gives you access to v8's Isolate interface. Versions of isolated-vm before v4.0.0 have API pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate. Reference objects allow access to the underlying reference's full prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a Reference instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to acquire a Reference to the nodejs context's Function object. Similar application-specific attacks could be possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects. Access to NativeModule objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the filesystem. If combined with, for example, a file upload API this would allow for arbitrary code execution. This is addressed in v4.0.0 through a series of related changes.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhj-4w6j-76h7   |   URL:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhj-4w6j-76h7   |   MISC:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v400   |   URL:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v400   |   MISC:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/2646e6c1558bac66285daeab54c7d490ed332b15   |   URL:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/2646e6c1558bac66285daeab54c7d490ed332b15   |   MISC:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/27151bfecc260e96714443613880e3b2e6596704   |   URL:https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/27151bfecc260e96714443613880e3b2e6596704",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-21423,Candidate,"`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the ""main"" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the ""main"" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/projen/projen/security/advisories/GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq   |   URL:https://github.com/projen/projen/security/advisories/GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq   |   MISC:https://github.com/projen/projen/commit/36030c6a4b1acd0054673322612e7c70e9446643   |   URL:https://github.com/projen/projen/commit/36030c6a4b1acd0054673322612e7c70e9446643   |   MISC:https://www.npmjs.com/package/projen   |   URL:https://www.npmjs.com/package/projen",Assigned (20201222),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
