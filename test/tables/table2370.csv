By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.","CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1199   |   URL:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1199   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MLIST:[activemq-issues] 20190703 [jira] [Created] (AMQ-7236) SEV-1 Security vulnerability in spring-expression-4.3.11.RELEASE.jar (spring framework)   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/4ed49b103f64a0cecb38064f26cbf1389afc12124653da2d35166dbe@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[activemq-issues] 20190703 [jira] [Updated] (AMQ-7236) SEV-1 Security vulnerability in spring-expression-4.3.11.RELEASE.jar (spring framework) and xstream-1.4.10.jar   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ab825fcade0b49becfa30235b3d54f4a51bb74ea96b6c9adb5d1378c@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[activemq-issues] 20190718 [jira] [Updated] (AMQ-7236) SEV-1 Security vulnerability in spring-expression-4.3.11.RELEASE.jar (spring framework) and xstream-1.4.10.jar   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/dcf8599b80e43a6b60482607adb76c64672772dc2d9209ae2170f369@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E   |   REDHAT:RHSA-2018:2405   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2405",Assigned (20171206),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2018-12025,Candidate,"The transferFrom function of a smart contract implementation for FuturXE (FXE), an Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to accomplish an unauthorized transfer of digital assets because of a logic error. The developer messed up with the boolean judgment - if the input value is smaller than or equal to allowed value, the transfer session would stop execution by returning false. This makes no sense, because the transferFrom() function should require the transferring value to not exceed the allowed value in the first place. Suppose this function asks for the allowed value to be smaller than the input. Then, the attacker could easily ignore the allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` would cause an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the value. The attacker could transfer any amount of FuturXe tokens of any accounts to an appointed account (the `_to` address) because the allowed value is initialized to 0, and the attacker could bypass this restriction even without the victim's private key.","MISC:https://medium.com/secbit-media/bugged-smart-contract-f-e-how-could-someone-mess-up-with-boolean-d2251defd6ff",Assigned (20180607),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
