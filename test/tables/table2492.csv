CVE-2007-3104,Red Hat,2007-10-18,Mark J Cox,This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3.
CVE-2007-3105,Red Hat,2007-10-18,Mark J Cox,This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3.
CVE-2007-3108,Red Hat,2007-08-14,Mark J Cox,"This paper describes a possible side-channel attack that hasnâ€™t been proven outside of a lab environment. In reality many factors would make this harder to exploit. If exploited, a local user could obtain RSA private keys (for example for web sites being run on the server). We have rated this as affecting Red Hat products with moderate security severity. Although the OpenSSL team have produced a patch for this issue, it is non-trivial and will require more testing before we can deploy it in a future update.  Our current plan is as follows:

- To include a backported fix in an OpenSSL update as part of Enterprise Linux 4.6. This will get testing via beta and give time for more extensive internal and upstream testing
- To release an update for OpenSSL for other platforms at the same time as 4.6 is released

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw."
CVE-2007-3144,Red Hat,2007-08-16,Mark J Cox,Not vulnerable.  Mozilla is no longer shipped as part of any version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  Mozilla was replaced by SeaMonkey in Red Hat Enterprise Linux by SeaMonkey which is not affected by this issue.
CVE-2007-3149,Red Hat,2007-06-11,Mark J Cox,"Not vulnerable.  Versions of sudo package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 2.1, 3, 4 and 5 are linked with PAM support and never use libkrb5 authentication."
CVE-2007-3205,Red Hat,2007-06-26,Mark J Cox,This is not a security vulnerability: it is the expected behaviour of parse_str when used without a second parameter.
CVE-2007-3278,Red Hat,2008-02-01,Mark J Cox,"Red Hat does not consider this do be a security issue.  dblink is disabled in default configuration of PostgreSQL packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 2.1, 3, 4 and 5, and it is a configuration decision whether to grant local users arbitrary access.

Fixes to correct this bug were included in PostgreSQL updates:

CVE-2007-3279,Red Hat,2007-09-28,Mark J Cox,Red Hat does not consider this do be a security issue. Creating functions is intended feature of the PL/pgSQL language and is definitely not a security problem. Weak passwords are generally more likely to be guessed with brute force attacks and choosing a strong password according to good practices is considered to be a sufficent protection against this kind of attack.
CVE-2007-3280,Red Hat,2007-09-28,Mark J Cox,Red Hat does not consider this do be a security issue.  The ability of the superuser to execute code on behalf of the database server is an intended feature and imposes no security threat as the superuser account is restricted to the database administrator.
