In combination with CVE-2017-12636 (Remote Code Execution), this can be used to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server as the database system user. The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two 'roles' keys are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising the document write, but the first 'roles' key is used for subsequent authorization for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves roles. The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges."

CVE-2017-12784,MEDIUM,"In Youngzsoft CCFile (aka CC File Transfer) 3.6, by sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible for a malicious user to remotely crash the affected software. No authentication is required. An example payload is a malformed request header with many '|' characters. NOTE: some sources use this ID for a NoviWare issue, but the correct ID for that issue is CVE-2017-12787."
CVE-2017-12785,HIGH,"The novish command-line interface, included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, is prone to a buffer overflow in the ""show log cli"" command. This could be used by a read-only user (monitor role) to gain privileged (root) code execution on the switch via command injection."
CVE-2017-12786,HIGH,"Network interfaces of the cliengine and noviengine services, included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an operator attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL modifications are applied. This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch, because there is a stack-based buffer overflow during unserialization of packet data."
CVE-2017-12787,HIGH,"A network interface of the novi_process_manager_daemon service, included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an operator attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL modifications are applied. This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch, because incoming packet data can contain embedded OS commands, and can also trigger a stack-based buffer overflow."
CVE-2017-12788,MEDIUM,Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in admin/index.php in Metinfo 5.3.18 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) class1 parameter or the (2) anyid parameter.
CVE-2017-12789,MEDIUM,Metinfo 5.3.18 is affected by: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The impact is: Information Disclosure (remote). The component is: admin/interface/online/delete.php. The attack vector is: The administrator clicks on the malicious link in the login state.
CVE-2017-1279,MEDIUM,"IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience 8.7, 8.8, and 9.0.2 could allow a remote attacker to traverse directories on the system. An attacker could send a specially-crafted URL request containing ""dot dot"" sequences (/../) to view arbitrary files on the system. IBM X-Force ID: 124757."
CVE-2017-12790,MEDIUM,Metinfo 5.3.18 is affected by: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The impact is: Information Disclosure (remote). The component is: admin/index.php. The attack vector is: The administrator clicks on the malicious link in the login state.
CVE-2017-12791,HIGH,Directory traversal vulnerability in minion id validation in SaltStack Salt before 2016.11.7 and 2017.7.x before 2017.7.1 allows remote minions with incorrect credentials to authenticate to a master via a crafted minion ID.
CVE-2017-12792,MEDIUM,"Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in NexusPHP 1.5 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the (1) linkname, (2) url, or (3) title parameter in an add action to linksmanage.php."
CVE-2017-12794,MEDIUM,"In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with ""DEBUG = True"" (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings."
CVE-2017-12795,HIGH,OpenMRS openmrs-module-htmlformentry 3.3.2 is affected by: (Improper Input Validation).
CVE-2017-12796,HIGH,"The Reporting Compatibility Add On before 2.0.4 for OpenMRS, as distributed in OpenMRS Reference Application before 2.6.1, does not authenticate users when deserializing XML input into ReportSchema objects. The result is that remote unauthenticated users are able to execute operating system commands by crafting malicious XML payloads, as demonstrated by a single admin/reports/reportSchemaXml.form request."
CVE-2017-12797,MEDIUM,"Integer overflow in the INT123_parse_new_id3 function in the ID3 parser in mpg123 before 1.25.5 on 32-bit platforms allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow."
CVE-2017-12798,MEDIUM,Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exists in NexusPHP version v1.5 via the q parameter to searchsuggest.php.
CVE-2017-12799,MEDIUM,The elf_read_notesfunction in bfd/elf.c in GNU Binutils 2.29 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file.
