CVE-2017-4933,Candidate,"VMware ESXi (6.5 before ESXi650-201710401-BG), Workstation (12.x before 12.5.8), and Fusion (8.x before 8.5.9) contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a heap overflow via a specific set of VNC packets resulting in heap corruption. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session. Note: In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the built-in firewall.","CONFIRM:https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0021.html   |   SECTRACK:1040024   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040024   |   SECTRACK:1040025   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040025",Assigned (20161226),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
