CVE-2020-2513,Candidate,"Vulnerability in the Oracle Application Express component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 5.1-19.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having SQL Workshop privilege with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Express. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Application Express, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Application Express accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Application Express accessible data.

CVE-2020-25130,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631. It is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to the fact that it is possible to inject malicious SQL statements in malformed parameter types. Sending an improper variable type of Array allows a bypass of core SQL Injection sanitization. Authenticated users are able to inject malicious SQL queries. This vulnerability leads to full database leak including ckeys that can be used in the authentication process without knowing the username and cleartext password. This can occur via the ajax/actions.php group_id field.","MISC:https://gist.github.com/mariuszpoplawski/243d1e7c07adc736bae8069fe831745c",Assigned (20200904),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
