The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the ""allow-recursion"" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if ""recursion no;"" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"" settings IF ""recursion yes;"" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of ""allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};"" if ""recursion yes;"" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for ""allow-query-cache"" or ""allow-query"".
