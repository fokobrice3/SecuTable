A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and result in a DoS condition. System recovery may require manual intervention.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the management interface of the affected software, which is typically connected to a restricted management network.","BID:105423   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105423   |   CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-webuidos   |   SECTRACK:1041737   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737",Assigned (20171127),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2018-0470,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly parsing malformed HTTP packets that are destined to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP packet to an affected device for processing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.","BID:105397   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105397   |   CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS XE Software HTTP Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-webdos   |   MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03   |   SECTRACK:1041737   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737",Assigned (20171127),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2018-0471,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) module of Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 16.6.1 and 16.6.2 could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak that may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash, triggering a reload of the affected device.","BID:105398   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105398   |   CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS XE Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Memory Leak Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-memleak   |   SECTRACK:1041737   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737",Assigned (20171127),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2018-0472,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the IPsec driver code of multiple Cisco IOS XE Software platforms and the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed IPsec Authentication Header (AH) or Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPsec packets to be processed by an affected device.

CVE-2018-0473,Candidate,"A vulnerability in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of the Precision Time Protocol. The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing of PTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a custom PTP packet to, or through, an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition for the PTP subsystem, resulting in time synchronization issues across the network.","BID:105427   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105427   |   CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS Software Precision Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability   |   URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-ptp   |   MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03   |   SECTRACK:1041737   |   URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737",Assigned (20171127),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
