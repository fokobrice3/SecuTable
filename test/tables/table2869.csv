CVE-2019-11043,HIGH,"In PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 in certain configurations of FPM setup it is possible to cause FPM module to write past allocated buffers into the space reserved for FCGI protocol data, thus opening the possibility of remote code execution."
CVE-2019-11044,MEDIUM,"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0 on Windows, PHP link() function accepts filenames with embedded \0 byte and treats them as terminating at that byte. This could lead to security vulnerabilities, e.g. in applications checking paths that the code is allowed to access."
CVE-2019-11045,MEDIUM,"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0, PHP DirectoryIterator class accepts filenames with embedded \0 byte and treats them as terminating at that byte. This could lead to security vulnerabilities, e.g. in applications checking paths that the code is allowed to access."
CVE-2019-11046,MEDIUM,"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0, PHP bcmath extension functions on some systems, including Windows, can be tricked into reading beyond the allocated space by supplying it with string containing characters that are identified as numeric by the OS but aren't ASCII numbers. This can read to disclosure of the content of some memory locations."
CVE-2019-11047,MEDIUM,"When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash."
CVE-2019-11048,MEDIUM,"In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.31, 7.3.x below 7.3.18 and 7.4.x below 7.4.6, when HTTP file uploads are allowed, supplying overly long filenames or field names could lead PHP engine to try to allocate oversized memory storage, hit the memory limit and stop processing the request, without cleaning up temporary files created by upload request. This potentially could lead to accumulation of uncleaned temporary files exhausting the disk space on the target server."
