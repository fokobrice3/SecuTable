CVE-2023-27577,Candidate,"flarum is a forum software package for building communities. In versions prior to 1.7.0 an admin account which has already been compromised by an attacker may use a vulnerability in the `LESS` parser which can be exploited to read sensitive files on the server through the use of path traversal techniques. An attacker can achieve this by providing an absolute path to a sensitive file in the custom `LESS` setting, which the `LESS` parser will then read. For example, an attacker could use the following code to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a linux machine. The scope of what files are vulnerable will depend on the permissions given to the running flarum process. The vulnerability has been addressed in version `1.7`. Users should upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring that their admin accounts are secured with strong passwords and follow other best practices for account security. Additionally, users can limit the exposure of sensitive files on the server by implementing appropriate file permissions and access controls at the operating system level.","MISC:https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/1761660c98ea5a3e9665fb8e6041d1f2ee62a444   |   URL:https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/1761660c98ea5a3e9665fb8e6041d1f2ee62a444   |   MISC:https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-vhm8-wwrf-3gcw   |   URL:https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-vhm8-wwrf-3gcw",Assigned (20230304),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-27601,Candidate,"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\n`). The vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\n`): By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.","MISC:https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/8f87c7c03da55f9c79bd92e67fa2c94b2a7ce5cf   |   URL:https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/8f87c7c03da55f9c79bd92e67fa2c94b2a7ce5cf   |   MISC:https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5x-g52f-548h   |   URL:https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5x-g52f-548h   |   MISC:https://opensips.org/docs/modules/3.3.x/sipmsgops.html   |   URL:https://opensips.org/docs/modules/3.3.x/sipmsgops.html   |   MISC:https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf   |   URL:https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf",Assigned (20230304),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
