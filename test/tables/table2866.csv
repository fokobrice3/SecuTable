CVE-2019-10050,MEDIUM,"A buffer over-read issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the decode-mpls.c function DecodeMPLS is composed only of a packet of source address and destination address plus the correct type field and the right number for shim, an attacker can manipulate the control flow, such that the condition to leave the loop is true. After leaving the loop, the network packet has a length of 2 bytes. There is no validation of this length. Later on, the code tries to read at an empty position, leading to a crash."
CVE-2019-10051,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. If the function filetracker_newchunk encounters an unsafe ""Some(sfcm) => { ft.new_chunk }"" item, then the program enters an smb/files.rs error condition and crashes."
CVE-2019-10052,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. If the network packet does not have the right length, the parser tries to access a part of a DHCP packet. At this point, the Rust environment runs into a panic in parse_clientid_option in the dhcp/parser.rs file."
CVE-2019-10053,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.x before 4.1.4. If the input of the function SSHParseBanner is composed only of a \n character, then the program runs into a heap-based buffer over-read. This occurs because the erroneous search for \r results in an integer underflow."
CVE-2019-10054,MEDIUM,An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The function process_reply_record_v3 lacks a check for the length of reply.data. It causes an invalid memory access and the program crashes within the nfs/nfs3.rs file.
CVE-2019-10055,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The function ftp_pasv_response lacks a check for the length of part1 and part2, leading to a crash within the ftp/mod.rs file."
CVE-2019-10056,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Suricata 4.1.3. The code mishandles the case of sending a network packet with the right type, such that the function DecodeEthernet in decode-ethernet.c is executed a second time. At this point, the algorithm cuts the first part of the packet and doesn't determine the current length. Specifically, if the packet is exactly 28 long, in the first iteration it subtracts 14 bytes. Then, it is working with a packet length of 14. At this point, the case distinction says it is a valid packet. After that it casts the packet, but this packet has no type, and the program crashes at the type case distinction."

CVE-2019-10062,MEDIUM,"The HTMLSanitizer class in html-sanitizer.ts in all released versions of the Aurelia framework 1.x repository is vulnerable to XSS. The sanitizer only attempts to filter SCRIPT elements, which makes it feasible for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via (for example) JavaScript code in an attribute of various other elements. An attacker might also exploit a bug in how the SCRIPT string is processed by splitting and nesting them for example."
CVE-2019-10063,MEDIUM,"Flatpak before 1.0.8, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 allows a sandbox bypass. Flatpak versions since 0.8.1 address CVE-2017-5226 by using a seccomp filter to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTI ioctl, which could otherwise be used to inject commands into the controlling terminal so that they would be executed outside the sandbox after the sandboxed app exits. This fix was incomplete: on 64-bit platforms, the seccomp filter could be bypassed by an ioctl request number that has TIOCSTI in its 32 least significant bits and an arbitrary nonzero value in its 32 most significant bits, which the Linux kernel would treat as equivalent to TIOCSTI."
CVE-2019-10064,MEDIUM,"hostapd before 2.6, in EAP mode, makes calls to the rand() and random() standard library functions without any preceding srand() or srandom() call, which results in inappropriate use of deterministic values. This was fixed in conjunction with CVE-2016-10743."

Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted."

CVE-2019-10084,MEDIUM,"In Apache Impala 2.7.0 to 3.2.0, an authenticated user with access to the IDs of active Impala queries or sessions can interact with those sessions or queries via a specially-constructed request and thereby potentially bypass authorization and audit mechanisms.

They were also not generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator, so are vulnerable to random number generator attacks that predict future IDs based on past IDs. Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a different authenticated user.
