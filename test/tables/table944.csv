This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a URI longer than 50 bytes. This leads to a heap overflow in wbs_post() via an strcpy() call.","CERT-VN:VU#608209   |   URL:https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209   |   MISC:https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/",Assigned (20210415),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-31227,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to an incorrect signed integer comparison. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a malformed HTTP packet with a negative Content-Length, which bypasses the size checks and results in a large heap overflow in the wbs_multidata buffer copy.","MISC:https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/   |   MISC:https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209",Assigned (20210415),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2021-31228,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. This vulnerability allows the attacker to predict a DNS query's source port in order to send forged DNS response packets that will be accepted as valid answers to the DNS client's requests (without sniffing the specific request). Data is predictable because it is based on the time of day, and has too few bits.","CERT-VN:VU#608209   |   URL:https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209   |   MISC:https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/",Assigned (20210415),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
