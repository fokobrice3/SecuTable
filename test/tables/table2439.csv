CVE-2005-1753,Red Hat,2006-08-30,Mark J Cox,"We do not believe this is a security issue; this is a deliberate circumvention of the Javamail API. The Javamail API provides a comprehensive and secure method to retrieve mail. In this example, the author retreives the message directly from the mail directory on the

permissions set by the dovecot and tomcat packages are enough to protect against
direct access to most of the files listed in the bug report."

If the OpenSSL Team decide to produce an update to correct this issue, we will consider including it in a future security update."
