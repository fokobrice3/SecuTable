SEE THE   |    EDITORIAL BOARD ARCHIVES FOR DETAILS, BEGINNING AT  |      |    http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00590.html  |      |    **********************************************************  |    Ziese>    |    I suggest we I'd like to suggest that we consider not tying  |    specifically to a DDOS tool.  Instead, since we are at at higher  |    abstraction level, that we make the class include those master/slave  |    tool combinations that are used for malicious purposes (i.e. DDOS,  |    data exfiltration, or whatever the appropriate classes of effect are).  |      |    My concern is that (1) we treat all distributed attacks at the same  |    abstract level; not just the DDOS ones.  Second, if it is at a higher  |    abstraction level then it seems right to unlimit it (by including  |    master/slave combinations in general; not just the DDOS asect).  |    Meunier> I think that trinoo etc... are very similar to smurf attacks  |    (CVE-1999-0513 ) in the sense that a third party allows itself to be  |    used.  Also, there is an  obvious solution that can only be done by  |    that third party.  |      |    As for the CVE entry, I am considering whether the common entry point  |    could be reduced to ""egress filtering has not been implemented or has  |    been disabled, allowing the sending of spoofed IP packets"".  |    Incidentally, this would prevent the use of decoys in port scans,  |    etc...  This single CVE entry would be very powerful. We could use  |    the dot notation to list the DDoS tools and attacks that rely on the  |    absence of egress filtering based on the argument that if you have  |    egress filtering, nobody will bother to put or use DDoS tools on your  |    computers.  |      |    The weakness of this is that one could in theory still use DDoS tools  |    even if you have egress filtering -- only they will be one shot guns,  |    almost completely eliminating their appeal and effectiveness.  One  |    use, and they will be blocked, tracked down and destroyed  |    efficiently.  |      |    Pascal  |      |    P.S.: I am attracted by the idea of starting an internet (fire)wall  |    of shame, for people who haven't implemented egress filtering.  It  |    worked pretty well against sites allowing themselves to be used for  |    smurf attacks (http://www.powertech.no/smurf/).  Why not use the same  |    strategy for egress filtering?  Of course it's hard to know who is  |    the source of IP spoofed  packets.  However the consistent detection  |    of crud originating from a server is a sure sign that they haven't  |    implemented egress filtering.  For example (my first candidate to  |    this wall of shame), this weekend the Linux suse ftp server sent many  |    packets with an illegal ip address as source, one reserved for local  |    area networks, upon making an ftp connection (it may still be doing  |    it, I haven't checked since -- the suse ftp admin mentioned that they  |    were aware of it).  It was easy to figure out it was them by  |    repeating the ftp connections and observing the 100% reproducibility  |    and time correlation of the extraneous packets.  In addition, the  |    suse servers kept sending me crud for *hours* after a failed attempt  |    to download their PPC beta.  |      |    The cost of egress filtering is easily justified.  The argument is  |    similar to those relating to pollution, excepted that people don't  |    try to break into your car if you have removed the catalytic  |    converter.  |    Bishop> I need to think about the exact meaning of MP. I suspect I  |    will agree with the classification, on an operational basis  |    (meaning I may want to revisit it), but I want to think on it  |    some more.  |    Blake> I don't agree with Pascal that this is a filtering problem analogous to  |    smurf.  Rootkit is a better analogy.  The DDoS software doesn't exploit  |    any unique vulnerability directly.  It's presence is entirely predicated  |    on the existence of at least one other, easily exploited vulnerability.  |     > From the perspective of the system owner, this is just one of several  |    backdoors that could be installed.  Seems to me that the presence of a  |    known backdoor package should be considered a vulnerability (or at least  |    an exposure).  |      |    I'm really torn on whether or not to split them out, though.  My  |    inclination is to group master and slave by package; i.e., trinoo  |    master/slave, tfn master/slave, etc.  |      |    Wall>    |    Just to be consistent, you may add Trinoo (trin00) and does it matter  |    if it is Tribal or Tribe?  The original internal c program says Tribe Flood  |    Network.  |    Meunier> What they have in common is the use of an amplification mechanism.  |    They are broadcasting (multicasting) to a (virtual private) network,  |    which then amplifies the messages.  In both cases, the amplification  |    is done by the third party victim hosts.  The difference is just that  |    the network is virtual instead of physical.  |      |      |    Scott, you are assuming that the people who have the tools installed  |    are unwilling.  Let's say theoretically speaking that there is an  |    underground hacker group (or student association) who is hooked up to  |    DSL lines (like in university residences) and who thinks that it  |    would be ""cool"" to form an ""army"".  How about a popular civil  |    movement protesting something, like the WTO last summer?  I think  |    some people would voluntarily ""enlist"" their computers in a cause  |    that would use DDoS attacks.  The rootkit analogy does not hold, yet  |    the DDoS attacks could be just as effective.  However, if the  |    university or ISPs implemented egress filtering, the DDoS attacks  |    could be easily stopped because the people could be held accountable.  |    The crux of the matter is the anonymity provided by IP spoofing.  |      |    You are correct that in most cases, having a DDoS tool installed on  |    your system is an exposure like rootkit.  Maybe that deserves a CVE  |    entry.  However, I think that does not capture the nature of the  |    DDoS, and that an entry about egress filtering is of utmost  |    importance because it patches a fundamental vulnerability of IPv4.  |    Blake> Excellent response, Pascal, thanks.  I hadn't thought of people  |    volunteering, but that's certainly a plausible scenario.  Part of my  |    motivation/thinking was a desire to stay away from making this into only  |    yet another use for spoofed IP packets.  I wholeheartedly agree that  |    egress filtering essential, but am reluctant to single out the recent DDoS  |    events as the reason for it.  |      |    I'd prefer to split out egress filtering as a seperate CVE entry (on the  |    theory that not using egress filtering constitutes an exposure -- at least  |    to liability), rather than tying it to these entries.  |    Levy> I agree with Scott for no other reason that there needs to be a CVE  |    ID so that IDS systems can report this things.  |      |    Are we going to start handing out CVE ids for low level design faults?  |    E.g. lack of encryption at the IPv4 packet level? lack of resource  |    allocation protocols? the used of DES instead of Triple DES? etc  |    Shostack> Both excellent points, however, I'd like to add that even if people  |    volunteer to host the tools, Trinoo and company allow the controlling  |    attacker to hide activities, which counts as an exposure under  |    http://cve.mitre.org/About_CVE/About/definition.html  |    Cole> Even with all of the debate i accept this one.  |    Christey> With respect to inclusion of design flaws in CVE, review  |    http://cve.mitre.org/Board_Sponsors/archives/msg00602.html  |      |    Other design flaws that have already been added to CVE  |    include Smurf (CVE-1999-0513), Fraggle (CVE-1999-0514)  |    and TCP sequence number prediction (CVE-1999-0077), although  |    this last one may need to be RECAST to a lower level of  |    abstraction.  |    CHANGE> [Meunier changed vote from REVIEWING to RECAST]  |    Meunier> In the sense that this is like a rootkit, then it is a  |    duplicate of CVE-1999-0660, ""A hacker utility or Trojan Horse is  |    installed on a system, e.g. NetBus, Back Orifice, Rootkit, etc...""  |      |    It should be recast as CVE-1999-0660.1 DDoS tools  |    Other dot notations could indicate different effects of the tools.  |    Dik> There doesn't seem to be much to add to the  |    discussion.  |    Baker> Concur that this is a hacker utility, and should be recast and merged with other backdoor programs that allow a hacker to control the activities of the system."
