CVE-2020-1665,Candidate,"On Juniper Networks MX Series and EX9200 Series, in a certain condition the IPv6 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection might not take affect when it reaches the threshold condition. The DDoS protection allows the device to continue to function while it is under DDoS attack, protecting both the Routing Engine (RE) and the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) during the DDoS attack. When this issue occurs, the RE and/or the FPC can become overwhelmed, which could disrupt network protocol operations and/or interrupt traffic. This issue does not affect IPv4 DDoS protection.

CVE-2020-1673,Candidate,"Insufficient Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection in Juniper Networks J-Web and web based (HTTP/HTTPS) services allows an unauthenticated attacker to hijack the target user's HTTP/HTTPS session and perform administrative actions on the Junos device as the targeted user. This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled such as J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to convince the device administrator to take action such as clicking the crafted URL sent via phishing email or convince the administrator to input data in the browser console.
