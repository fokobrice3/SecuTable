CVE-2021-32805,Candidate,"Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask.

CVE-2021-32806,Candidate,"Products.isurlinportal is a replacement for isURLInPortal method in Plone. Versions of Products.isurlinportal prior to 1.2.0 have an Open Redirect vulnerability. Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal. The url `https:example.org` without slashes is considered to be in the portal. When redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others give an error. Attackers may use this to redirect victims to their site, especially as part of a phishing attack.

CVE-2021-32807,Candidate,"The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope ""Manager"" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf   |   URL:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf   |   MISC:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#51-2021-07-30   |   URL:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#51-2021-07-30   |   MISC:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/b42dd4badf803bb9fb71ac34cd9cb0c249262f2c   |   URL:https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/b42dd4badf803bb9fb71ac34cd9cb0c249262f2c",Assigned (20210512),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
