CVE-2020-11739,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the ""critical"" section. As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.","CONFIRM:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4723   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-295ed0b1e0   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5M2XRNCHOGGTJQBZQJ7DCV6ZNAKN3LE2/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-440457afe4   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YMAW7D2MP6RE4BFI5BZWOBBWGY3VSOFN/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-cbc3149753   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NVTP4OYHCTRU3ONFJOFJQVNDFB25KLLG/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202005-08   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-08   |   MISC:https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200414 Xen Security Advisory 314 v3 (CVE-2020-11739) - Missing memory barriers in read-write unlock paths   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/14/2   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0599   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00006.html",Assigned (20200414),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-11767,Candidate,"Istio through 1.5.1 and Envoy through 1.14.1 have a data-leak issue. If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to *.example.com, a request for a domain concurrently configured explicitly (e.g., abc.example.com) is sent to the server(s) listening behind *.example.com. The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users. If a victim is interacting with abc.example.com, and a server (for abc.example.com) recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server. This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error. Similarly, this behavior voids the security model browsers have put in place between domains.","MISC:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=954160#c5   |   MISC:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/6767   |   MISC:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13589   |   MISC:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9429",Assigned (20200415),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
