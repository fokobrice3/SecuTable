CVE-2020-11053,Candidate,"In OAuth2 Proxy before 5.1.1, there is an open redirect vulnerability. Users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites. However, by crafting a redirect URL with HTML encoded whitespace characters the validation could be bypassed and allow a redirect to any URL provided. This has been patched in 5.1.1.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-j7px-6hwj-hpjg",Assigned (20200330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2020-11054,Candidate,"In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificate errors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to false, which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions of qutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions before v0.11.x couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater than or equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but no further releases are planned.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-4rcq-jv2f-898j   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-f0812d6aad   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKAZOOTJ2MBHTYVYQQ52NL53F5CB2XAP/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-fcd5fd47bd   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7YWJ5QNHXKTGG5NLV7EGEOKPBVZBA5GS/   |   MISC:https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=420902   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/021ab572a319ca3db5907a33a59774f502b3b975   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/19f01bb42d02da539446a52a25bb0c1232b86327   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/1b7946ed14b386a24db050f2d6dba81ba6518755   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/2281a205c3e70ec20f35ec8fafecee0d5c4f3478   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/4020210b193f77cf1785b21717f6ef7c5de5f0f8   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/6821c236f9ae23adf21d46ce0d56768ac8d0c467   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/9bd1cf585fccdfe8318fff7af793730e74a04db3   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/a45ca9c788f648d10cccce2af41405bf25ee2948   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/d28ed758d077a5bf19ddac4da468f7224114df23   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/f5d801251aa5436aff44660c87d7013e29ac5864   |   MISC:https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5403   |   MISC:https://tracker.die-offenbachs.homelinux.org/eric/issue328",Assigned (20200330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-11069,Candidate,"In TYPO3 CMS 9.0.0 through 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 through 10.4.1, it has been discovered that the backend user interface and install tool are vulnerable to a same-site request forgery. A backend user can be tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker previously managed to upload to the web server. Scripts are then executed with the privileges of the victims' user session. In a worst-case scenario, new admin users can be created which can directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it's actually a same-site request forgery. Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user using a third party extension, e.g. file upload in a contact form with knowing the target location. To be successful, the attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install tool user session at the time of the attack. This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2. The deployment of additional mitigation techniques is suggested as described below. - Sudo Mode Extension This TYPO3 extension intercepts modifications to security relevant database tables, e.g. those storing user accounts or storages of the file abstraction layer. Modifications need to confirmed again by the acting user providing their password again. This technique is known as sudo mode. This way, unintended actions happening in the background can be mitigated. - https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/sudo-mode - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sudo_mode - Content Security Policy Content Security Policies tell (modern) browsers how resources served a particular site are handled. It is also possible to disallow script executions for specific locations. In a TYPO3 context, it is suggested to disallow direct script execution at least for locations /fileadmin/ and /uploads/.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-pqg8-crx9-g8m4",Assigned (20200330),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-11091,Candidate,"In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host.
