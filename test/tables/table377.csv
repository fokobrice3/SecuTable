CVE-2019-12017,Candidate,"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in MapR CLDB code, specifically in the JSON framework that is used in the CLDB code that handles login and ticket issuance. An attacker can use the 'class' property of the JSON request sent to the CLDB to influence the JSON library's decision on which Java class this JSON request is deserialized to. By doing so, the attacker can force the MapR CLDB to construct a URLClassLoader which loads a malicious Java class from a remote path and instantiate this object in the MapR CLDB, thus executing arbitrary code on the machine running the MapR CLDB and take over the cluster. By switching to the newer Jackson library and ensuring that all incoming JSON requests are only deserialized to the same class that it was serialized from, the vulnerability is fixed.

CVE-2019-12086,Candidate,"A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.","BID:109227   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109227   |   BUGTRAQ:20190527 [SECURITY] [DSA 4452-1] jackson-databind security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/68   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9   |   URL:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.9   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190530-0003/   |   URL:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190530-0003/   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4452   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4452   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-99ff6aa32c   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKUALE2TUCKEKOHE2D342PQXN4MWCSLC/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-ae6a703b8f   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OVRZDN2T6AZ6DJCZJ3VSIQIVHBVMVWBL/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-fb23eccc03   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TXRVXNRFHJSQWFHPRJQRI5UPMZ63B544/   |   MISC:http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/   |   URL:http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/   |   MISC:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326   |   URL:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2326   |   MISC:https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062   |   URL:https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html   |   MISC:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   URL:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html   |   MLIST:[cassandra-commits] 20190919 [jira] [Created] (CASSANDRA-15328) Bump jackson version to >= 2.9.9.3 to address security vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3f99ae8dcdbd69438cb733d745ee3ad5e852068490719a66509b4592@%3Ccommits.cassandra.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190521 [SECURITY] [DLA 1798-1] jackson-databind security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/05/msg00030.html   |   MLIST:[drill-dev] 20191017 Dependencies used by Drill contain known vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b0656d359c7d40ec9f39c8cc61bca66802ef9a2a12ee199f5b0c1442@%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[drill-dev] 20191021 [jira] [Created] (DRILL-7416) Updates required to dependencies to resolve potential security vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/519eb0fd45642dcecd9ff74cb3e71c20a4753f7d82e2f07864b5108f@%3Cdev.drill.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[drill-issues] 20191021 [jira] [Created] (DRILL-7416) Updates required to dependencies to resolve potential security vulnerabilities   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f9bc3e55f4e28d1dcd1a69aae6d53e609a758e34d2869b4d798e13cc@%3Cissues.drill.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[lucene-solr-user] 20200320 CVEs (vulnerabilities) that apply to Solr 8.4.1   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r204ba2a9ea750f38d789d2bb429cc0925ad6133deea7cbc3001d96b5@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[nifi-commits] 20191113 svn commit: r1869773 -
