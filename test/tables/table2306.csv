CVE-2017-6657,Candidate,"Cisco Sourcefire Snort 3.0 before build 233 mishandles Ether Type Validation. Since valid ether type and IP protocol numbers do not overlap, Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array. That makes it possible to craft packets that have IP protocol numbers in the ether type field which will confuse the Snort++ decoder. For example, an eth:llc:snap:icmp6 packet will cause a crash because there is no ip6 header with which to calculate the icmp6 checksum. Affected decoders include gre, llc, trans_bridge, ciscometadata, linux_sll, and token_ring. The fix adds a check in the packet manager to validate the ether type before indexing the decoder array.
