CVE-2016-8744,Candidate,"Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs. SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java type available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated user with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run Java code without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files and network connections, and execute system commands.

CVE-2016-8745,Candidate,"A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13, 8.5.0 to 8.5.8, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39, 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 and 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 resulted in the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can result in information leakage between requests including, not not limited to, session ID and the response body. The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.","BID:94828   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94828   |   CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html   |   CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2017-3236626.html   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180607-0002/   |   DEBIAN:DSA-3754   |   URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3754   |   DEBIAN:DSA-3755   |   URL:http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3755   |   GENTOO:GLSA-201705-09   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201705-09   |   MLIST:[announce] 20170105 [SECURITY][UPDATE] CVE-2016-8745 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure   |   URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/4113c05d37f37c12b8033205684f04033c5f7a9bae117d4af23b32b4@%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E   |   MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20190319 svn commit: r1855831 [23/30] -
