CVE-2023-28431,Candidate,"Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Frontier's `modexp` precompile uses `num-bigint` crate under the hood. In the implementation prior to pull request 1017, the cases for modulus being even and modulus being odd are treated separately. Odd modulus uses the fast Montgomery multiplication, and even modulus uses the slow plain power algorithm. This gas cost discrepancy was not accounted for in the `modexp` precompile, leading to possible denial of service attacks. No fixes for `num-bigint` are currently available, and thus this issue is fixed in the short term by raising the gas costs for even modulus, and in the long term fixing it in `num-bigint` or switching to another modexp implementation. The short-term fix for Frontier is deployed at pull request 1017. There are no known workarounds aside from applying the fix.","MISC:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/5af12e94d7dfc8a0208a290643a800f55de7b219   |   URL:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/commit/5af12e94d7dfc8a0208a290643a800f55de7b219   |   MISC:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/1017   |   URL:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/1017   |   MISC:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-fcmm-54jp-7vf6   |   URL:https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/security/advisories/GHSA-fcmm-54jp-7vf6   |   MISC:https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint/blob/6f2b8e0fc218dbd0f49bebb8db2d1a771fe6bafa/src/biguint/power.rs#L134   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint/blob/6f2b8e0fc218dbd0f49bebb8db2d1a771fe6bafa/src/biguint/power.rs#L134",Assigned (20230315),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Tailscale SSH commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the following criteria: the destination node was a FreeBSD device with Tailscale SSH enabled; Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for non-root users; and a non-interactive SSH session was used.

To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option.

The vulnerability impacts both GeoNode 3 and GeoNode 4 instances. Geoserver security configuration is provided by `geoserver-geonode-ext`.

CVE-2023-28444,Candidate,"angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation.","MISC:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/commit/d701f51260637a84ede278e248934e0437a7ff86   |   URL:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/commit/d701f51260637a84ede278e248934e0437a7ff86   |   MISC:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/releases/tag/v15.1.0   |   URL:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/releases/tag/v15.1.0   |   MISC:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/security/advisories/GHSA-gwvm-vrp4-4pp5   |   URL:https://github.com/kyubisation/angular-server-side-configuration/security/advisories/GHSA-gwvm-vrp4-4pp5",Assigned (20230315),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0.1 and later may be vulnerable if the application is installed with Java environment 7u21 and earlier. Exploitation of the vulnerability depends on two factors: insecure deserialization methods used in the Adobe LiveCycle application, and the use of Java environments 7u21 and earlier. The code execution is performed in the context of the account that is running the Adobe LiveCycle application. If the account is privileged, exploitation provides privileged access to the operating system. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.","MISC:https://coastalsecurity.gitbook.io/critical-vulnerability-adobe-livecycle-es4v11.0/",Assigned (20230316),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
