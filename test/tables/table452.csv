CVE-2019-19577,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 AMD HVM guest OS users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by triggering data-structure access during pagetable-height updates. When running on AMD systems with an IOMMU, Xen attempted to dynamically adapt the number of levels of pagetables (the pagetable height) in the IOMMU according to the guest's address space size. The code to select and update the height had several bugs. Notably, the update was done without taking a lock which is necessary for safe operation. A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to access data structures while they are being modified, causing Xen to crash. Privilege escalation is thought to be very difficult but cannot be ruled out. Additionally, there is a potential memory leak of 4kb per guest boot, under memory pressure. Only Xen on AMD CPUs is vulnerable. Xen running on Intel CPUs is not vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable. Only HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability. PV and PVH guests cannot.

CVE-2019-19578,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service via degenerate chains of linear pagetables, because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595. ""Linear pagetables"" is a technique which involves either pointing a pagetable at itself, or to another pagetable of the same or higher level. Xen has limited support for linear pagetables: A page may either point to itself, or point to another pagetable of the same level (i.e., L2 to L2, L3 to L3, and so on). XSA-240 introduced an additional restriction that limited the ""depth"" of such chains by allowing pages to either *point to* other pages of the same level, or *be pointed to* by other pages of the same level, but not both. To implement this, we keep track of the number of outstanding times a page points to or is pointed to another page table, to prevent both from happening at the same time. Unfortunately, the original commit introducing this reset this count when resuming validation of a partially-validated pagetable, incorrectly dropping some ""linear_pt_entry"" counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occur, they might be able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetables, as described in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only systems which have enabled linear pagetables are vulnerable. Systems which have disabled linear pagetables, either by selecting CONFIG_PV_LINEAR_PT=n when building the hypervisor, or adding pv-linear-pt=false on the command-line, are not vulnerable.","BUGTRAQ:20200114 [SECURITY] [DSA 4602-1] xen security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4602   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-2e12bd3a9a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/34HBFTYNMQMWIO2GGK7DB6KV4M6R5YPV/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-6aad703290   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D5R73AYE53QA32KTMHUVKCX6E52CIS43/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202003-56   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-56   |   MISC:https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-309.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0011   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html",Assigned (20191204),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-19579,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain host OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to a physical device (and assignable-add is not used), because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18424. XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's ""assignable-add"" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well. Hosts where these ""alternate"" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.","BUGTRAQ:20200114 [SECURITY] [DSA 4602-1] xen security update   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21   |   CONFIRM:http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-306.html   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4602   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-3d7105bd2a   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RJYT5FNGM7JSVHHW6B22TSAATBOAPFPD/   |   MISC:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/11/26/2   |   MISC:https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-306.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20191205 Xen Security Advisory 306 v3 (CVE-2019-19579) - Device quarantine for alternate pci assignment methods   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/05/7   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0011   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html",Assigned (20191204),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
