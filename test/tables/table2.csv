CWE-ID,Name,Weakness Abstraction,Status,Description
20,Improper Input Validation,Class,Stable,The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.
22,Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),Base,Stable,The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
59,Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'),Base,Draft,The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.
78,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'),Base,Stable,The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.
79,Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),Base,Stable,The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
89,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'),Base,Stable,The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
94,Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),Base,Draft,The product constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.
119,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,Class,Stable,The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
134,Use of Externally-Controlled Format String,Base,Draft,The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.
200,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,Class,Draft,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
287,Improper Authentication,Class,Draft,When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.
352,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),Compound,Stable,The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.
362,Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),Class,Draft,The product contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently.
