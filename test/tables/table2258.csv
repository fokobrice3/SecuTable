CVE-2017-18509,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in net/ipv6/ip6mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11. By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause an inet_csk_listen_stop general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances. The issue can be triggered as root (e.g., inside a default LXC container or with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) or after namespace unsharing. This occurs because sk_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6_mroute_* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.187.","BUGTRAQ:20190814 [slackware-security] Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2019-226-01)   |   URL:https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/26   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K41582535   |   CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K41582535?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4497   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4497   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154059/Slackware-Security-Advisory-Slackware-14.2-kernel-Updates.html   |   MISC:https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=99253eb750fda6a644d5188fb26c43bad8d5a745   |   MISC:https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/99253eb750fda6a644d5188fb26c43bad8d5a745   |   MISC:https://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2017/12/04/40   |   MISC:https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/linux-kernel-4.9-inetcsklistenstop-gpf   |   MISC:https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/commit/baefcdc2f29923e7325ce4e1a72c3ff0a9800f32   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190814 [SECURITY] [DLA 1884-1] linux security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00016.html   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190814 [SECURITY] [DLA 1885-1] linux-4.9 security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00017.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4145-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4145-1/",Assigned (20190813),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
