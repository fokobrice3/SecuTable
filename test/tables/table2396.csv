CVE-2009-1631,Red Hat,2009-12-07,Mark J Cox,"Red Hat does not consider this to be a security issue. By default, user home directories are created with mode 0700 permissions, which would not expose the ~/.evolution/ directory regardless of its own permissions.

If a user intentionally relaxes permissions on their home directory, they should be auditing all files and directories in order to not expose unwanted files to other local users."
