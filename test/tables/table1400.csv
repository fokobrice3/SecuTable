CVE-2023-0286,Candidate,"There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.","MISC:1.0.2zg patch (premium)   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd2af07dc083a350c959147097003a14a5e8ac4d   |   MISC:1.1.1t git commit   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2c6c9d439b484e1ba9830d8454a34fa4f80fdfe9   |   MISC:3.0.8 git commit   |   URL:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=2f7530077e0ef79d98718138716bc51ca0cad658   |   MISC:OpenSSL Advisory   |   URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt   |   MISC:https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt   |   URL:https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-3.6.2-relnotes.txt   |   MISC:https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig   |   URL:https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/018_x509.patch.sig",Assigned (20230113),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-0290,Candidate,"Rapid7 Velociraptor did not properly sanitize the client ID parameter to the CreateCollection API, allowing a directory traversal in where the collection task could be written. It was possible to provide a client id of ""../clients/server"" to schedule the collection for the server (as a server artifact), but only require privileges to schedule collections on the client. Normally, to schedule an artifact on the server, the COLLECT_SERVER permission is required. This permission is normally only granted to ""administrator"" role. Due to this issue, it is sufficient to have the COLLECT_CLIENT privilege, which is normally granted to the ""investigator"" role. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at least ""investigator"" level, and be able to authenticate to the GUI and issue an API call to the backend. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group, and most users will already be administrators within the GUI. This issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5. Version 0.6.7-5, released January 16, 2023, fixes the issue.","MISC:https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor   |   URL:https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor",Assigned (20230113),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
