CVE-2020-5252,Candidate,"The command-line ""safety"" package for Python has a potential security issue. There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to &#8220;poison-pill&#8221; command-line Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself. This can happen if: You are running Safety in a Python environment that you don&#8217;t trust. You are running Safety from the same Python environment where you have your dependencies installed. Dependency packages are being installed arbitrarily or without proper verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing any of the following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running the Safety Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r requirements.txt Run Safety against a static dependencies list, such as the requirements.txt file, in a separate, clean Python environment. Run Safety from a Continuous Integration pipeline. Use PyUp.io, which runs Safety in a controlled environment and checks Python for dependencies without any need to install them. Use PyUp's Online Requirements Checker.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/akoumjian/python-safety-vuln   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/pyupio/safety/security/advisories/GHSA-7q25-qrjw-6fg2   |   CONFIRM:https://pyup.io/posts/patched-vulnerability/",Assigned (20200102),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-5260,Candidate,"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external ""credential helper"" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211141   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4657   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-4e093619bb   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-b2a2c830cf   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-c6548b488f   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7TVS5UG6JD3MYIGSBKMIOS6AF7CR5IPI/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-cdef88bb89   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XPCEOIFLLEF24L6GLVJVFZX4CREDEHDF/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2020-f6b3b6fb18   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202004-13   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13   |   MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html   |   MISC:https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b   |   MISC:https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/   |   MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20200415 [SECURITY] [DLA 2177-1] git security update   |   URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200415 CVE-2020-5260: Git: malicious URLs may cause Git to present stored credentials to the wrong server   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200415 Re: CVE-2020-5260: Git: malicious URLs may cause Git to present stored credentials to the wrong server   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/6   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20200420 CVE-2020-11008: Git: Malicious URLs can still cause Git to send a stored credential to the wrong server   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/20/1   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0524   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00027.html   |   SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0598   |   URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html   |   UBUNTU:USN-4329-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/4329-1/",Assigned (20200102),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2020-5303,Candidate,"Tendermint before versions 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 has a denial-of-service vulnerability. Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each p2p connection, it allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint does not reclaim activeID of a peer after it's removed in Mempool reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and added to all reactors. RemovePeer is therefore called before AddPeer, which leads to always growing memory (activeIDs map). The activeIDs map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting above denial of service), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking. These issues are patched in Tendermint 0.33.3 and 0.32.10.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-v24h-pjjv-mcp6   |   URL:https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-v24h-pjjv-mcp6   |   MISC:https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/e2d6859afd7dba4cf97c7f7d412e7d8fc908d1cd   |   URL:https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/e2d6859afd7dba4cf97c7f7d412e7d8fc908d1cd   |   MISC:https://hackerone.com/reports/820317   |   URL:https://hackerone.com/reports/820317",Assigned (20200102),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
