CVE-2021-41090,Candidate,"Grafana Agent is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack. Prior to versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2, inline secrets defined within a metrics instance config are exposed in plaintext over two endpoints: metrics instance configs defined in the base YAML file are exposed at `/-/config` and metrics instance configs defined for the scraping service are exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/:key`. Inline secrets will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints. If HTTPS with client authentication is not configured, these endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users. Secrets found in these sections are used for delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system, authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets, and authenticating against a system for collecting metrics. This does not apply for non-inlined secrets, such as `*_file` based secrets. This issue is patched in Grafana Agent versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2. A few workarounds are available. Users who cannot upgrade should use non-inline secrets where possible. Users may also desire to restrict API access to Grafana Agent with some combination of restricting the network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through `http_listen_address` in the `server` block, configuring Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication, and/or using firewall rules to restrict external access to Grafana Agent's API.","CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211229-0004/   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/grafana/agent/security/advisories/GHSA-9c4x-5hgq-q3wh   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/agent/security/advisories/GHSA-9c4x-5hgq-q3wh   |   MISC:https://github.com/grafana/agent/commit/af7fb01e31fe2d389e5f1c36b399ddc46b412b21   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/agent/commit/af7fb01e31fe2d389e5f1c36b399ddc46b412b21   |   MISC:https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/1152   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/1152   |   MISC:https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.20.1   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.20.1   |   MISC:https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.21.2   |   URL:https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.21.2",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41100,Candidate,"Wire-server is the backing server for the open source wire secure messaging application. In affected versions it is possible to trigger email address change of a user with only the short-lived session token in the `Authorization` header. As the short-lived token is only meant as means of authentication by the client for less critical requests to the backend, the ability to change the email address with a short-lived token constitutes a privilege escalation attack. Since the attacker can change the password after setting the email address to one that they control, changing the email address can result in an account takeover by the attacker. Short-lived tokens can be requested from the backend by Wire clients using the long lived tokens, after which the long lived tokens can be stored securely, for example on the devices key chain. The short lived tokens can then be used to authenticate the client towards the backend for frequently performed actions such as sending and receiving messages. While short-lived tokens should not be available to an attacker per-se, they are used more often and in the shape of an HTTP header, increasing the risk of exposure to an attacker relative to the long-lived tokens, which are stored and transmitted in cookies. If you are running an on-prem instance and provision all users with SCIM, you are not affected by this issue (changing email is blocked for SCIM users). SAML single-sign-on is unaffected by this issue, and behaves identically before and after this update. The reason is that the email address used as SAML NameID is stored in a different location in the databse from the one used to contact the user outside wire. Version 2021-08-16 and later provide a new end-point that requires both the long-lived client cookie and `Authorization` header. The old end-point has been removed. If you are running an on-prem instance with at least some of the users invited or provisioned via SAML SSO and you cannot update then you can block `/self/email` on nginz (or in any other proxies or firewalls you may have set up). You don't need to discriminate by verb: `/self/email` only accepts `PUT` and `DELETE`, and `DELETE` is almost never used.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9rm2-w6pq-333m   |   URL:https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9rm2-w6pq-333m",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

Where things go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with ""true"" random data in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator, the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971). However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use node's CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto` object is null because a variable was declared with the same name, and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However, when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008] with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros. Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9. In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`. 2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/security/advisories/GHSA-3f99-hvg4-qjwj   |   URL:https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/security/advisories/GHSA-3f99-hvg4-qjwj   |   MISC:https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-1012-keypair/   |   URL:https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-1012-keypair/",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41129,Candidate,"Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-5vfx-8w6m-h3v4   |   URL:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-5vfx-8w6m-h3v4   |   MISC:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/v1.6.2/CHANGELOG.md#v162   |   URL:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/v1.6.2/CHANGELOG.md#v162   |   MISC:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/4a84c36009be10dbd83051ac1771662c056e4977   |   URL:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/4a84c36009be10dbd83051ac1771662c056e4977   |   MISC:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.6.2   |   URL:https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.6.2",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41133,Candidate,"Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q   |   DEBIAN:DSA-4984   |   URL:https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4984   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-4b201d15e6   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R5656ONDP2MGKIJMKEC7N2NXCV27WGTC/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2021-c5a9c85737   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T5DKCYRC6MFSTFCUP4DELCOUUP3SFEFX/   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/1330662f33a55e88bfe18e76de28b7922d91a999   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/1330662f33a55e88bfe18e76de28b7922d91a999   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/26b12484eb8a6219b9e7aa287b298a894b2f34ca   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/26b12484eb8a6219b9e7aa287b298a894b2f34ca   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/462fca2c666e0cd2b60d6d2593a7216a83047aaf   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/462fca2c666e0cd2b60d6d2593a7216a83047aaf   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4c34815784e9ffda5733225c7d95824f96375e36   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4c34815784e9ffda5733225c7d95824f96375e36   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/89ae9fe74c6d445bb1b3a40e568d77cf5de47e48   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/89ae9fe74c6d445bb1b3a40e568d77cf5de47e48   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/9766ee05b1425db397d2cf23afd24c7f6146a69f   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/9766ee05b1425db397d2cf23afd24c7f6146a69f   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/a10f52a7565c549612c92b8e736a6698a53db330   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/a10f52a7565c549612c92b8e736a6698a53db330   |   MISC:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/e26ac7586c392b5eb35ff4609fe232c52523b2cf   |   URL:https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/e26ac7586c392b5eb35ff4609fe232c52523b2cf   |   MLIST:[oss-security] 20211026 WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit Security Advisory WSA-2021-0006   |   URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/26/9",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41136,Candidate,"Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9.

CVE-2021-41158,Candidate,"FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, an attacker can perform a SIP digest leak attack against FreeSWITCH and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured on the FreeSWITCH server. This is done by challenging FreeSWITCH's SIP requests with the realm set to that of the gateway, thus forcing FreeSWITCH to respond with the challenge response which is based on the password of that targeted gateway. Abuse of this vulnerability allows attackers to potentially recover gateway passwords by performing a fast offline password cracking attack on the challenge response. The attacker does not require special network privileges, such as the ability to sniff the FreeSWITCH's network traffic, to exploit this issue. Instead, what is required for this attack to work is the ability to cause the victim server to send SIP request messages to the malicious party. Additionally, to exploit this issue, the attacker needs to specify the correct realm which might in some cases be considered secret. However, because many gateways are actually public, this information can easily be retrieved. The vulnerability appears to be due to the code which handles challenges in `sofia_reg.c`, `sofia_reg_handle_sip_r_challenge()` which does not check if the challenge is originating from the actual gateway. The lack of these checks allows arbitrary UACs (and gateways) to challenge any request sent by FreeSWITCH with the realm of the gateway being targeted. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7. Maintainers recommend that one should create an association between a SIP session for each gateway and its realm to make a check be put into place for this association when responding to challenges.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-3v3f-99mv-qvj4   |   URL:https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-3v3f-99mv-qvj4   |   FULLDISC:20211026 [ES2021-05] FreeSWITCH vulnerable to SIP digest leak for configured gateways   |   URL:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/40   |   MISC:https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.7   |   URL:https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.7",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2021-41192,Candidate,"Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. If an admin sets up Redash versions 10.0.0 and prior without explicitly specifying the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` or `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, a default value is used for both that is the same across all installations. In such cases, the instance is vulnerable to attackers being able to forge sessions using the known default value. This issue only affects installations where the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET or REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables have not been explicitly set. This issue does not affect users of the official Redash cloud images, Redash's Digital Ocean marketplace droplets, or the scripts in the `getredash/setup` repository. These instances automatically generate unique secret keys during installation. One can verify whether one's instance is affected by checking the value of the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable. If it is `c292a0a3aa32397cdb050e233733900f`, should follow the steps to secure the instance, outlined in the GitHub Security Advisory.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/getredash/redash/security/advisories/GHSA-g8xr-f424-h2rv   |   URL:https://github.com/getredash/redash/security/advisories/GHSA-g8xr-f424-h2rv   |   MISC:https://ian.sh/redash   |   MISC:https://github.com/getredash/redash/commit/ce60d20c4e3d1537581f2f70f1308fe77ab6a214   |   URL:https://github.com/getredash/redash/commit/ce60d20c4e3d1537581f2f70f1308fe77ab6a214",Assigned (20210915),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
