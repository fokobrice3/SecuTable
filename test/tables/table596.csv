CVE-2020-14934,Candidate,"Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP agent. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. If the number of variables in the request exceeds the allocated buffer, a memory write out of the buffer boundaries occurs. This write operation provides a possibility to overwrite other variables allocated in the .bss section by the application. Because the sender of the frame is in control of the content that will be written beyond the buffer limits, and there is no strict process memory separation, this issue may allow overwriting of sensitive memory areas of an IoT device.","MISC:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NIf0Y0S47Lu85uSi29kt9tgSh0jYZYfj/view?usp=sharing   |   MISC:https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/1352",Assigned (20200621),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2020-14935,Candidate,"Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP bulk get request response encoding function. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. When a bulk get request response is assembled, a stack buffer dedicated for OIDs (with a limited capacity) is allocated in snmp_engine_get_bulk(). When snmp_engine_get_bulk() is populating the stack buffer, an overflow condition may occur due to lack of input length validation. This makes it possible to overwrite stack regions beyond the allocated buffer, including the return address from the function. As a result, the code execution path may be redirected to an address provided in the SNMP bulk get payload. If the target architecture uses common addressing space for program and data memory, it may also be possible to supply code in the SNMP request payload, and redirect the execution path to the remotely injected code, by modifying the function's return address.","MISC:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qp3ZXaFRiR_imWg0lUbI7-D-hIT268EB/view?usp=sharing   |   MISC:https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/1353",Assigned (20200621),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

The function snmp_oid_decode_oid() may overwrite memory areas beyond the provided target buffer, when called from snmp_message_decode() upon an SNMP request reception.
