The bug is in segments validation code in file 'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c' in function hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object *hdr_jobj) where the code does not check for possible overflow on memory allocation used for intervals array (see statement ""intervals = malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));""). Due to the bug, library can be *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far less memory then originally expected. Later it may read data FROM image crafted by an attacker and actually write such data BEYOND allocated memory."
CVE-2020-14383,MEDIUM,"A flaw was found in samba's DNS server. An authenticated user could use this flaw to the RPC server to crash.
