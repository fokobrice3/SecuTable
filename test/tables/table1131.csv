CVE-2022-21658,Candidate,"Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.","CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213182   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213183   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213186   |   CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213193   |   CONFIRM:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/security/advisories/GHSA-r9cc-f5pr-p3j2   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/security/advisories/GHSA-r9cc-f5pr-p3j2   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-06569a0a60   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7JKZDTBMGAWIFJSNWKBMPO5EAKRR4BEW/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-1b76e3a192   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CKGTACKMKAPRDPWPTU26GYWBELIRFF5N/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-1bafa3fc91   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BK32QZLHDC2OVLPKTUHNT2G3VHWHD4LX/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2022-2c73789458   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C63NH72Q7UHJM5V3IVYRI7LVBGGFQMSQ/   |   GENTOO:GLSA-202210-09   |   URL:https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-09   |   MISC:https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/20/cve-2022-21658.html   |   URL:https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/20/cve-2022-21658.html   |   MISC:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110   |   MISC:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/32ed6e599bb4722efefd78bbc9cd7ec4613cb946   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/32ed6e599bb4722efefd78bbc9cd7ec4613cb946   |   MISC:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/406cc071d6cfdfdb678bf3d83d766851de95abaf   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/406cc071d6cfdfdb678bf3d83d766851de95abaf   |   MISC:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/4f0ad1c92ca08da6e8dc17838070975762f59714   |   URL:https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93110/commits/4f0ad1c92ca08da6e8dc17838070975762f59714",Assigned (20211116),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2022-21675,Candidate,"Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite. Versions of the package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA ""Zip Slip""). The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim&#8217;s machine. The impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an attacker to create or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should upgrade to BCV v2.11.0 when possible to receive a patch.
