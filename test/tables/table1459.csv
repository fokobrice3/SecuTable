CVE-2023-24816,Candidate,"IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted or filtered input.","MISC:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/3f0bf05f072a91b2a3042d23ce250e5e906183fd/IPython/utils/terminal.py#L103-L117   |   URL:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/3f0bf05f072a91b2a3042d23ce250e5e906183fd/IPython/utils/terminal.py#L103-L117   |   MISC:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/56e6925dfa50e2c7f4a6471547b8176275db7c25/IPython/utils/_process_win32.py#L20   |   URL:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/56e6925dfa50e2c7f4a6471547b8176275db7c25/IPython/utils/_process_win32.py#L20   |   MISC:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/385d69325319a5972ee9b5983638e3617f21cb1f   |   URL:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/385d69325319a5972ee9b5983638e3617f21cb1f   |   MISC:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-29gw-9793-fvw7   |   URL:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-29gw-9793-fvw7",Assigned (20230130),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""

CVE-2023-24827,Candidate,"syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`) during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.","MISC:https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3   |   URL:https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3   |   MISC:https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956   |   URL:https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956",Assigned (20230130),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
