CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2018-10170,HIGH,"NordVPN 6.12.7.0 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the ""nordvpn-service"" service. This service establishes an NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The ""Connect"" method accepts a class instance argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user."
CVE-2018-10171,HIGH,Kromtech MacKeeper 3.20.4 suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability through its `com.mackeeper.AdwareAnalyzer.AdwareAnalyzerPrivilegedHelper` component. The AdwareAnalzyerPrivilegedHelper tool implements an XPC service that allows an unprivileged application to connect and execute shell scripts as the root user.
CVE-2018-10172,HIGH,"7-Zip through 18.01 on Windows implements the ""Large memory pages"" option by calling the LsaAddAccountRights function to add the SeLockMemoryPrivilege privilege to the user's account, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using this privilege in the context of a sandboxed process."
CVE-2018-10173,HIGH,Digital Guardian Management Console 7.1.2.0015 allows authenticated remote code execution because of Arbitrary File Upload functionality.
CVE-2018-10174,MEDIUM,"Digital Guardian Management Console 7.1.2.0015 has an SSRF issue that allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via file:// URLs, send TCP traffic to intranet hosts, or obtain an NTLM hash. This can occur even if the logged-in user has a read-only role."
CVE-2018-10175,MEDIUM,Digital Guardian Management Console 7.1.2.0015 has an XXE issue.
CVE-2018-10176,MEDIUM,Digital Guardian Management Console 7.1.2.0015 has a Directory Traversal issue.
CVE-2018-10177,MEDIUM,"In ImageMagick 7.0.7-28, there is an infinite loop in the ReadOneMNGImage function of the coders/png.c file. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted mng file."

CVE-2018-10183,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in BigTree 4.2.22. There is cross-site scripting (XSS) in /core/inc/lib/less.php/test/index.php because of a $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] echo, as demonstrated by the dir parameter in a file=charsets action."
CVE-2018-10184,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 frame length was checked against the max_frame_size setting instead of being checked against the bufsize. The max_frame_size only applies to outgoing traffic and not to incoming, so if a large enough frame size is advertised in the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame will be defragmented into a temporary allocated buffer where the second fragment may overflow the heap by up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this can be exploited for code execution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses not realistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediate crash is absolutely certain."
CVE-2018-10185,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in TuziCMS v2.0.6. There is a CSRF vulnerability that can add an admin account, as demonstrated by a history.pushState call."
CVE-2018-10186,MEDIUM,"In radare2 2.5.0, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the r_hex_bin2str function (libr/util/hex.c). Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted DEX file. This issue is different from CVE-2017-15368."

CVE-2018-10189,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Mautic 1.x and 2.x before 2.13.0. It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled."
CVE-2018-1019,HIGH,"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge, aka ""Chakra Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability."" This affects Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2018-0979, CVE-2018-0980, CVE-2018-0990, CVE-2018-0993, CVE-2018-0994, CVE-2018-0995."
CVE-2018-10190,HIGH,"A vulnerability in London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v77 for Windows could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to run executable files with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of access controls. The ""Changelog"" and ""Help"" options available from the system tray context menu spawn an elevated instance of the user's default web browser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by selecting ""Run as Administrator"" from the context menu of an executable file within the file browser of the spawned default web browser.

An attacker that can cause Ruby code to be run can use this to possibly execute arbitrary code."
CVE-2018-10192,HIGH,"IPVanish 3.0.11 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon implements an insecure XPC service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user. IPVanish uses a third-party library for converting `xpc_object_t` types in to `NSObject` types for sending XPC messages. When IPVanish establishes a new connection, the following XPC message is sent to the `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon. Because the XPC service itself does not validate an incoming connection, any application installed on the operating system can send it XPC messages. In the case of the ""connect"" message, an attacker could manipulate the `OpenVPNPath` to point at a malicious binary on the system. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` would receive the VPNHelperConnect command, and then execute the malicious binary as the root user."
CVE-2018-10193,MEDIUM,LogMeIn LastPass through 4.15.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser hang) via an HTML document because the resource consumption of onloadwff.js grows with the number of INPUT elements.

CVE-2018-10204,HIGH,"PureVPN 6.0.1 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its ""sevpnclient"" service. When configured to use the OpenVPN protocol, the ""sevpnclient"" service executes ""openvpn.exe"" using the OpenVPN config file located at %PROGRAMDATA%\purevpn\config\config.ovpn. This file allows ""Write"" permissions to users in the ""Everyone"" group. An authenticated attacker may modify this file to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM account."

CVE-2018-10252,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered on Actiontec WCB6200Q before 1.1.10.20a devices. The admin login session cookie is insecurely generated making admin session hijacking possible. When an admin logs in, a session cookie is generated using the time of day rounded to 10ms. Since the web server returns its current time of day in responses, it is possible to step backward through possible session values until a working one is found.

CVE-2018-10361,HIGH,An issue was discovered in KTextEditor 5.34.0 through 5.45.0. Insecure handling of temporary files in the KTextEditor's kauth_ktexteditor_helper service (as utilized in the Kate text editor) can allow other unprivileged users on the local system to gain root privileges. The attack occurs when one user (who has an unprivileged account but is also able to authenticate as root) writes a text file using Kate into a directory owned by a another unprivileged user. The latter unprivileged user conducts a symlink attack to achieve privilege escalation.
CVE-2018-10362,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers."
