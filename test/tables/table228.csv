CVE-2018-16882,Candidate,"A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.","MISC:106254   |   URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106254   |   MISC:USN-3871-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3871-1/   |   MISC:USN-3871-3   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3871-3/   |   MISC:USN-3871-4   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3871-4/   |   MISC:USN-3871-5   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3871-5/   |   MISC:USN-3872-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3872-1/   |   MISC:USN-3878-1   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3878-1/   |   MISC:USN-3878-2   |   URL:https://usn.ubuntu.com/3878-2/   |   MISC:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-16882   |   URL:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-16882   |   MISC:https://lwn.net/Articles/775720/   |   URL:https://lwn.net/Articles/775720/   |   MISC:https://lwn.net/Articles/775721/   |   URL:https://lwn.net/Articles/775721/   |   MISC:https://marc.info/?l=kvm&m=154514994222809&w=2   |   URL:https://marc.info/?l=kvm&m=154514994222809&w=2   |   MISC:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K80557033   |   URL:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K80557033",Assigned (20180911),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
