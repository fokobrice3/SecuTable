The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, malicious HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect users to malicious sites."
CVE-2020-3371,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary code and execute arbitrary commands at the underlying operating system level. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the web-based management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands at the underlying operating system level."
CVE-2020-3372,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to consume excessive system memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and could result in a DoS condition."
CVE-2020-3373,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the IP fragment-handling implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on an affected device. This memory leak could prevent traffic from being processed through the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when specific failures occur during IP fragment reassembly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, fragmented IP traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on the affected device and eventually impact traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The device could require a manual reboot to recover from the DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6) traffic."
CVE-2020-3374,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization, enabling them to access sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. The attacker may be able to access sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system."
CVE-2020-3375,HIGH,"A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to information that they are not authorized to access, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, and execute commands on an affected system with privileges of the root user."
CVE-2020-3376,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the Device Manager application of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a failure in the software to perform proper authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to one of the hosted URLs in Cisco DCNM. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interact with and use certain functions within the Cisco DCNM."
CVE-2020-3377,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the Device Manager application of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted arguments to a specific field within the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands as the administrator on the DCNM."
CVE-2020-3378,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface for Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of an affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input that includes SQL statements to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data."
CVE-2020-3379,HIGH,"A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative privileges."
CVE-2020-3380,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of an affected CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as the fmserver user and submitting malicious input to a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system."
CVE-2020-3381,MEDIUM,"A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read and write access to sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of files that are uploaded to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify arbitrary files on the targeted system."
CVE-2020-3382,HIGH,"A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrative privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because different installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges."
