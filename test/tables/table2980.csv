CVE-2020-7212,HIGH,"The _encode_invalid_chars function in util/url.py in the urllib3 library 1.25.2 through 1.25.7 for Python allows a denial of service (CPU consumption) because of an inefficient algorithm. The percent_encodings array contains all matches of percent encodings. It is not deduplicated. For a URL of length N, the size of percent_encodings may be up to O(N). The next step (normalize existing percent-encoded bytes) also takes up to O(N) for each step, so the total time is O(N^2). If percent_encodings were deduplicated, the time to compute _encode_invalid_chars would be O(kN), where k is at most 484 ((10+6*2)^2)."
CVE-2020-7213,HIGH,"Parallels 13 uses cleartext HTTP as part of the update process, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. Users of out-of-date versions are presented with a pop-up window for a parallels_updates.xml file on the http://update.parallels.com web site."
CVE-2020-7215,LOW,"An issue was discovered in Gallagher Command Centre 7.x before 7.90.991(MR5), 8.00 before 8.00.1161(MR5), and 8.10 before 8.10.1134(MR4). External system configuration data (used for third party integrations such as DVR systems) were logged in the Command Centre event trail. Any authenticated operator with the 'view events' privilege could see the full configuration, including cleartext usernames and passwords, under the event details of a Modified DVR System event."
CVE-2020-7216,MEDIUM,An ni_dhcp4_parse_response memory leak in openSUSE wicked 0.6.55 and earlier allows network attackers to cause a denial of service by sending DHCP4 packets without a message type option.
CVE-2020-7217,MEDIUM,An ni_dhcp4_fsm_process_dhcp4_packet memory leak in openSUSE wicked 0.6.55 and earlier allows network attackers to cause a denial of service by sending DHCP4 packets with a different client-id.
CVE-2020-7218,MEDIUM,"HashiCorp Nomad and Nonad Enterprise up to 0.10.2 HTTP/RPC services allowed unbounded resource usage, and were susceptible to unauthenticated denial of service. Fixed in 0.10.3."
CVE-2020-7219,MEDIUM,"HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise up to 1.6.2 HTTP/RPC services allowed unbounded resource usage, and were susceptible to unauthenticated denial of service. Fixed in 1.6.3."
CVE-2020-7220,MEDIUM,"HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 0.11.0 through 1.3.1 fails, in certain circumstances, to revoke dynamic secrets for a mount in a deleted namespace. Fixed in 1.3.2."
CVE-2020-7221,HIGH,"mysql_install_db in MariaDB 10.4.7 through 10.4.11 allows privilege escalation from the mysql user account to root because chown and chmod are performed unsafely, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on a chmod 04755 of auth_pam_tool_dir/auth_pam_tool. NOTE: this does not affect the Oracle MySQL product, which implements mysql_install_db differently."
CVE-2020-7222,MEDIUM,An issue was discovered in Amcrest Web Server 2.520.AC00.18.R 2017-06-29 WEB 3.2.1.453504. The login page responds with JavaScript when one tries to authenticate. An attacker who changes the result parameter (to true) in this JavaScript code can bypass authentication and achieve limited privileges (ability to see every option but not modify them).
CVE-2020-7224,HIGH,"The Aviatrix OpenVPN client through 2.5.7 on Linux, macOS, and Windows is vulnerable when OpenSSL parameters are altered from the issued value set; the parameters could allow unauthorized third-party libraries to load."
