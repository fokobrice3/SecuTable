CVE-ID,CVSS Risk Score,Summary.
CVE-2020-11068,MEDIUM,"In LoRaMac-node before 4.4.4, a reception buffer overflow can happen due to the received buffer size not being checked. This has been fixed in 4.4.4."
CVE-2020-11069,MEDIUM,"In TYPO3 CMS 9.0.0 through 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 through 10.4.1, it has been discovered that the backend user interface and install tool are vulnerable to a same-site request forgery. A backend user can be tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker previously managed to upload to the web server. Scripts are then executed with the privileges of the victims' user session. In a worst-case scenario, new admin users can be created which can directly be used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it's actually a same-site request forgery. Malicious payload such as HTML containing JavaScript might be provided by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated user using a third party extension, e.g. file upload in a contact form with knowing the target location. To be successful, the attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install tool user session at the time of the attack. This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2. The deployment of additional mitigation techniques is suggested as described below. - Sudo Mode Extension This TYPO3 extension intercepts modifications to security relevant database tables, e.g. those storing user accounts or storages of the file abstraction layer. Modifications need to confirmed again by the acting user providing their password again. This technique is known as sudo mode. This way, unintended actions happening in the background can be mitigated. - https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/sudo-mode - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sudo_mode - Content Security Policy Content Security Policies tell (modern) browsers how resources served a particular site are handled. It is also possible to disallow script executions for specific locations. In a TYPO3 context, it is suggested to disallow direct script execution at least for locations /fileadmin/ and /uploads/."
CVE-2020-1107,LOW,"A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected SharePoint server, aka 'Microsoft SharePoint Spoofing Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1104, CVE-2020-1105."
CVE-2020-11070,LOW,The SVG Sanitizer extension for TYPO3 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions before 1.0.3. Slightly invalid or incomplete SVG markup is not correctly processed and thus not sanitized at all. Albeit the markup is not valid it still is evaluated in browsers and leads to cross-site scripting. This is fixed in version 1.0.3.
CVE-2020-11071,MEDIUM,"SLPJS (npm package slpjs) before version 0.27.2, has a vulnerability where users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton. This is fixed in version 0.27.2."
CVE-2020-11072,MEDIUM,"In SLP Validate (npm package slp-validate) before version 1.2.1, users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton. This has been fixed in slp-validate in version 1.2.1. Additonally, slpjs version 0.27.2 has a related fix under related CVE-2020-11071."
CVE-2020-11073,MEDIUM,"In Autoswitch Python Virtualenv before version 0.16.0, a user who enters a directory with a malicious `.venv` file could run arbitrary code without any user interaction. This is fixed in version: 1.16.0"
CVE-2020-11074,LOW,"In PrestaShop from version 1.5.3.0 and before version 1.7.6.6, there is a stored XSS when using the name of a quick access item. The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.6."
CVE-2020-11075,MEDIUM,"In Anchore Engine version 0.7.0, a specially crafted container image manifest, fetched from a registry, can be used to trigger a shell escape flaw in the anchore engine analyzer service during an image analysis process. The image analysis operation can only be executed by an authenticated user via a valid API request to anchore engine, or if an already added image that anchore is monitoring has its manifest altered to exploit the same flaw. A successful attack can be used to execute commands that run in the analyzer environment, with the same permissions as the user that anchore engine is run as - including access to the credentials that Engine uses to access its own database which have read-write ability, as well as access to the running engien analyzer service environment. By default Anchore Engine is released and deployed as a container where the user is non-root, but if users run Engine directly or explicitly set the user to 'root' then that level of access may be gained in the execution environment where Engine runs. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.1."
CVE-2020-11076,MEDIUM,"In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.4 and 3.12.5, an attacker could smuggle an HTTP response, by using an invalid transfer-encoding header. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.5 and Puma 4.3.4."
CVE-2020-11077,MEDIUM,"In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5."
CVE-2020-11078,MEDIUM,"In httplib2 before version 0.18.0, an attacker controlling unescaped part of uri for `httplib2.Http.request()` could change request headers and body, send additional hidden requests to same server. This vulnerability impacts software that uses httplib2 with uri constructed by string concatenation, as opposed to proper urllib building with escaping. This has been fixed in 0.18.0."
CVE-2020-11079,HIGH,node-dns-sync (npm module dns-sync) through 0.2.0 allows execution of arbitrary commands . This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This has been fixed in 0.2.1.
CVE-2020-1108,MEDIUM,"A denial of service vulnerability exists when .NET Core or .NET Framework improperly handles web requests, aka '.NET Core & .NET Framework Denial of Service Vulnerability'."
CVE-2020-11080,MEDIUM,"In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection."
CVE-2020-11081,MEDIUM,"osquery before version 4.4.0 enables a privilege escalation vulnerability. If a Window system is configured with a PATH that contains a user-writable directory then a local user may write a zlib1.dll DLL, which osquery will attempt to load. Since osquery runs with elevated privileges this enables local escalation. This is fixed in version 4.4.0."
CVE-2020-11082,MEDIUM,"In Kaminari before 1.2.1, there is a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into pages with pagination links. This has been fixed in 1.2.1."
CVE-2020-11083,LOW,"In October from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.466, a user with access to a markdown FormWidget that stores data persistently could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other users with access to the generated HTML from the field. This has been fixed in 1.0.466. For users of the RainLab.Blog plugin, this has also been fixed in 1.4.1."
CVE-2020-11084,MEDIUM,"In iPear, the manual execution of the eval() function can lead to command injection. Only PCs where commands are manually executed via ""For Developers"" are affected. This function allows executing any PHP code within iPear which may change, damage, or steal data (files) from the PC."
CVE-2020-11085,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before 2.1.0, there is an out-of-bounds read in cliprdr_read_format_list. Clipboard format data read (by client or server) might read data out-of-bounds. This has been fixed in 2.1.0."
CVE-2020-11086,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.0.0, there is an out-of-bound read in ntlm_read_ntlm_v2_client_challenge that reads up to 28 bytes out-of-bound to an internal structure. This has been fixed in 2.1.0."

CVE-2020-1109,HIGH,"An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Update Stack fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka 'Windows Update Stack Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1110."
CVE-2020-11090,MEDIUM,"In Indy Node 1.12.2, there is an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability. Indy Node has a bug in TAA handling code. The current primary can be crashed with a malformed transaction from a client, which leads to a view change. Repeated rapid view changes have the potential of bringing down the network. This is fixed in version 1.12.3."
CVE-2020-11091,LOW,"In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host. Weave Net version 2.6.3 disables the accept_ra option on the veth devices that it creates."
CVE-2020-11093,MEDIUM,"Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID."
CVE-2020-11094,MEDIUM,"The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain sensitive information from those requests. There even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users, which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable, and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different permission that's more restrictive."
CVE-2020-11095,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, an out of bound reads occurs resulting in accessing a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the static array PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES. This is fixed in version 2.1.2."
CVE-2020-11096,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is a global OOB read in update_read_cache_bitmap_v3_order. As a workaround, one can disable bitmap cache with -bitmap-cache (default). This is fixed in version 2.1.2."
CVE-2020-11097,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, an out of bounds read occurs resulting in accessing a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the static array PRIMARY_DRAWING_ORDER_FIELD_BYTES. This is fixed in version 2.1.2."
CVE-2020-11098,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out-of-bound read in glyph_cache_put. This affects all FreeRDP clients with `+glyph-cache` option enabled This is fixed in version 2.1.2."
CVE-2020-11099,MEDIUM,"In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in license_read_new_or_upgrade_license_packet. A manipulated license packet can lead to out of bound reads to an internal buffer. This is fixed in version 2.1.2."
CVE-2020-1110,HIGH,"An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Update Stack fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka 'Windows Update Stack Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-1109."
CVE-2020-11100,MEDIUM,"In hpack_dht_insert in hpack-tbl.c in the HPACK decoder in HAProxy 1.8 through 2.x before 2.1.4, a remote attacker can write arbitrary bytes around a certain location on the heap via a crafted HTTP/2 request, possibly causing remote code execution."
CVE-2020-11102,MEDIUM,hw/net/tulip.c in QEMU 4.2.0 has a buffer overflow during the copying of tx/rx buffers because the frame size is not validated against the r/w data length.
CVE-2020-11103,HIGH,"JsLink in Webswing before 2.6.12 LTS, and 2.7.x and 20.x before 20.1, allows remote code execution."
CVE-2020-11104,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. Serialization of an (initialized) C/C++ long double variable into a BinaryArchive or PortableBinaryArchive leaks several bytes of stack or heap memory, from which sensitive information (such as memory layout or private keys) can be gleaned if the archive is distributed outside of a trusted context."
CVE-2020-11105,HIGH,"An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. It employs caching of std::shared_ptr values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if an std::shared_ptr variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new std::shared_ptr is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized std::shared_ptr variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests."
CVE-2020-11106,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF'][""view_type""] wasn't sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the ""view"" action and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION['RF'][""view_type""] variable, but there it wasn't sanitized."
CVE-2020-11107,MEDIUM,"An issue was discovered in XAMPP before 7.2.29, 7.3.x before 7.3.16 , and 7.4.x before 7.4.4 on Windows. An unprivileged user can change a .exe configuration in xampp-contol.ini for all users (including admins) to enable arbitrary command execution."
CVE-2020-11108,HIGH,"The Gravity updater in Pi-hole through 4.4 allows an authenticated adversary to upload arbitrary files. This can be abused for Remote Code Execution by writing to a PHP file in the web directory. (Also, it can be used in conjunction with the sudo rule for the www-data user to escalate privileges to root.) The code error is in gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl in gravity.sh."
