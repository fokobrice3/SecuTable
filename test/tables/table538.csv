CVE-2019-9945,Candidate,"SoftNAS Cloud 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 allows remote command execution. The NGINX default configuration file has a check to verify the status of a user cookie. If not set, a user is redirected to the login page. An arbitrary value can be provided for this cookie to access the web interface without valid user credentials. If customers have not followed SoftNAS deployment best practices and expose SoftNAS StorageCenter ports directly to the internet, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the Webadmin interface to create new users or execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges, compromising both the platform and the data.","MISC:https://www.digitaldefense.com/blog/2019-softnas-cloud-zero-day-blog/",Assigned (20190323),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-9946,Candidate,"Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) CNI (Container Networking Interface) 0.7.4 has a network firewall misconfiguration which affects Kubernetes. The CNI 'portmap' plugin, used to setup HostPorts for CNI, inserts rules at the front of the iptables nat chains; which take precedence over the KUBE- SERVICES chain. Because of this, the HostPort/portmap rule could match incoming traffic even if there were better fitting, more specific service definition rules like NodePorts later in the chain. The issue is fixed in CNI 0.7.5 and Kubernetes 1.11.9, 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0.","CONFIRM:https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/269#issuecomment-477683272   |   CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190416-0002/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-24217abfdf   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SGOOWAELGH3F7OXRBPH3HCNZELNLXYTW/   |   FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d2b57d3b19   |   URL:https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FCN66VYB3XS76SYH567SO7N3I254JOCT/   |   REDHAT:RHBA-2019:0862   |   URL:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0862",Assigned (20190323),"None (candidate not yet proposed)",""
CVE-2019-9947,Candidate,"An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3.
