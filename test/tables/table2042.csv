The procedural  |    differences between the individual exploits for each of these utilities  |    are therefore inconsequential. CVE-1999-0988 should be merged with  |    CVE-1999-0828. From the standpoint of maintaining consistency of the  |    level of abstraction used in CVE, the co-existence of CANS  |    1999-0988/1999-0828 present two choices: either merge 0988 with 0828, or  |    split 0828 into 4 distinct candidates, keeping 0988 intact. Due to the  |    very small differences (in principle) between the exploits subsumed by  |    0828 and 0988 and the shared dacread permissions of the pkg* suite, I  |    suggest a merge. Below is a summary of the data upon which my decision  |    was based.  |    utility         exploit  |    --------      ----------------------------------   |    pkgtrans  --> symlink + dacread permission prob  |    pkginfo   --> truss (debugging utility) in conjunction with pkginfio -d  |    etc/shadow. In this case, it captures the interaction between  |    pkginfo                the shadow file. Once again: dacread.  |    pkgcat    --> buffer overflow  + dacread permission prob  |    pkginstall -> buffer overflow + dacread permission prob  |    pkgparam --> -f etc/shadow (works because of dacread).  |    Christey> This is a tough one.  While there are few procedural  |    differences, one could view ""assignment of an improper  |    permission"" as a ""class"" of problems along the lines of  |    buffer overflows and the like.  Just like some programs  |    were fine until they got turned into CGI scripts, this  |    could be an emerging pattern which should be given  |    consideration.  Consider the Eyedog and scriptlet.typelib  |    ActiveX utilities being marked as safe for scripting  |    (CVE-1999-0668 and 0669).  |      |    ftp://ftp.sco.com/SSE/security_bulletins/SB-99.28a loosely  |    alludes to this problem; the README for patch SSE053  |    effectively confirms it.  |    Frech> XF:unixware-pkgtrans-symlink"
